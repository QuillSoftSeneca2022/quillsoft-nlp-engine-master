		We now report on the clinical and epidemio Methods Surveillance Full details of the methods, along with sensitivity and uncertainty analyses, are provided in Supplementary Appendix one available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org; a summary is provided here. Case definitions for EVD have been reported previously by the WHO. In brief, a suspected case is illness in any person, alive or dead, who has sudden onset of high fever and had contact with a person with a suspected, probable, or confirmed Ebola case or with a dead or sick animal; any person with sudden onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms: headache, vomiting, anorexia or loss of appetite, diarrhea, lethargy, stomach pain, aching muscles or joints, difficulty swallowing, breathing difficulties, or hiccupping; or any person who had unexplained bleeding or who died suddenly from an unexplained because. A probable case is illness in any person suspected to have EVD who was evaluated by a clinician or any person who died from suspected Ebola and had an epidemiologic link to a person with a confirmed case but was not tested and did not have laboratory confirmation of the disease. A probable or suspected case was classified as confirmed when a sample from the person was positive for Ebola virus in laboratory testing. Clinical and demographic data were collected with the use of a standard case investigation form on confirmed, probable, and suspected EVD cases identified through clinical care, including hospitalization, and through contact tracing in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. To create the fullest possible picture of the unfolding epidemic, these data were supplemented by information collected in informal case reports, by data from diagnostic laboratories, and from burial records. The data recorded for each case included the district of residence, the district in which the disease was reported, the patient s age, sex, and signs two n engl j med nejm.org Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa and symptoms, the date of symptom onset and of case detection, the name of the hospital, the date of hospitalization, and the date of death or discharge. A subgroup of case patients provided information on potentially infectious contacts with other persons who had Ebola virus disease, including possible exposure at funerals. We present here the results from analyses of detailed data on individual confirmed and probable cases recorded by each country in databases provided to the WHO as of September fourteen two0one; analyses of confirmed and probable cases, together with suspected cases, are provided in Supplementary Appendix one

	Title: Clinical Manifestations and Case Fatality Rate
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		We report on the frequency of symptoms in patients with confirmed and probable EVD cases overall and by country. We evaluated potential risk factors for a fatal outcome, including sex, age group. We performed the analysis using logistic-regression models, with data on patients for whom there was a definitive outcome by August seventeen two thousand and fourteen The case fatality rate was calculated as the percentage of fatal EVD cases among reported cases with a known definitive clinical outcome. For comparison, we also calculated a case fatality rate that was based only on the ratio of reported deaths to reported cases, including in the denominator cases for which the clinical outcome is unknown.

	Title: Key Time Periods

		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		We investigated five key time periods that characterize the progression of infection, the detection, care, and recovery or death of a person with Ebola virus disease, and the transmission of infection : the incubation period, which is the time between infection and the onset of symptoms.

We then estimated R0 for the early stages of the epidemic, when transmission rates were at their highest, on the basis of the date of symptom onset. As described in Supplementary Appendix one average estimates of Rt for the period from July twenty eight to September seven two thousand and fourteen which were made on the basis of the date of report to facilitate comparison with future cases, were used to project future cases, allowing for both uncertainty in the estimates of Rt and stochastic variability in the transmission process.

The median age of persons with EVD was thirty two years, and there were no significant differences in the age distribution of persons with EVD among countries. The majority of persons with EVD were between fifteen and forty four years of age. EVD has taken a heavy toll among health care workers in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. By September fourteen a total of three hundred and eighteen cases, including one hundred and fifty one deaths, had been reported among health care workers.

		In December two thousand and thirteen the first cases occurred in Gu ck dou and Macenta districts, the focus of the epidemic in Guinea. During March two thousand and fourteen a rise in the numbers of cases in these two districts, in addition to the first reports from Lofa and other districts in Liberia, was followed by the discovery of cases in the capital, Conakry. A second increase in case incidence in Guinea first in Gu ck dou and Macenta and then in the capital occurred in May and June. During May, the focus of the epidemic in Guinea expanded to the neighboring districts of Kenema and Kailahun in Sierra Leone, and in June further cases were reported in Lofa district in Liberia. These five districts have remained the An animated map with timeline available at NEJM.org Results Scale of the Epidemic A total of four thousand, five hundred and seven confirmed and probable EVD cases were reported to the WHO between December thirty two thousand and thirteen and September fourteen two thousand and fourteen a thirty seven-week period. A total of seven hundred and eighteen confirmed and probable cases and two hundred and eighty nine deaths were reported in the week of September eight through September fourteen alone. The numbers of confirmed and probable cases reported by each country over time are shown in Figures one and two Detailed information was available on three thousand, three hundred and forty three confirmed and six hundred and sixty seven probable cases; these cases were used in all our analyses, with the exception of projections. The true case load, including suspected cases and undetected cases, will be higher still. of symptoms to hospitalization, a measure of the period of infectiousness in the community, was five four point seven days, and was no shorter for health care workers than for other case patients. The mean time to death after admission to the hospital was four point two six point four days, and the mean time to discharge was eleven point eight six point one days. The mean length of stay in hospital was six point four days in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

Although R0 reflects the maximum potential for growth in case incidence, Sseven in Supplementary Appendix one shows the variation in the estimated net repro Discussion Although the current epidemic of EVD in West Africa is unprecedented in scale, the clinical course of infection and the transmissibility of the virus are similar to those in previous EVD outbreaks. The incubation period, duration of illness, case fatality rate, and R0 are all within the ranges reported for previous EVD epidemics. seven  We infer that the present epidemic is exceptionally large, not principally because of the biologic characteristics of the virus, but rather because of the attributes of the affected populations and because control efforts have been insufficient to halt the spread of infection. n engl j med nejm.org seven

		The ne w engl and jour nal of medicine Certain characteristics of the affected populations may have led to the rapid geographic dissemination of infection. The populations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are highly interconnected, with much cross-border traffic at the epicenter and relatively easy connections by road between rural towns and villages and between densely populated national capitals. The large intermixing population has facilitated the spread of infection, but a large epidemic was not inevitable. In Nigeria, the number of cases has so far been limited, despite the introduction of infection into the large cities of Lagos   will be required while stocks remain limited. For the medium term, at least, we must therefore face the possibility that EVD will become endemic among the human population of West Africa, a prospect that has never previously been contemplated. The risk of continued epidemic expansion and the prospect of endemic EVD in West Africa call for the most forceful implementation of present control measures and for the rapid development and deployment of new drugs and vaccines.
