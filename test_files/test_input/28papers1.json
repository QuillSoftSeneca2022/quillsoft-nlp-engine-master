{"title": "Chapter 1 Global Epidemiology of Ebola Disease: A Review of the West African Outbreak", "abstract": "EVD is a disease of humans and other non-human primates caused by Ebola viruses, which was first discovered in 196. Between 196 and  there had been  outbreaks of the disease. The recent outbreak is the 26th and has seen more deaths than all other outbreaks from the disease combined. This outbreak in West Africa occurred in five countries: Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. In the present research article, the authors reviewed various studies and current research on EVD. EVD was initially restricted to West Africa when the outbreak was first identified but later was reported in several countries around the world, including the USA. Researchers have begun to use mathematical analysis from previous outbreaks to construct the Atangana's Beta Ebola System of Equations, which is being used to predict the spread of future outbreaks. The pathophysiology and transmission factors, including the basic and effective reproduction numbers, R0 and Re are discussed in detail. Prevention and control measures, such as proper hygiene techniques, education, are outlined. The history and current outbreak are reviewed in detail, which compares the differences in previous outbreaks compared to the current. Earlier outbreaks have also been traced to the ZEBOV strain, and researchers suggest that the evolutionary rate of gene mutations was accelerated in this current outbreak. Death occurs in approximately  of affected individuals within - days after the onset of initial symptoms and is most often associated with multi-organ failure. Researchers outline the who is criteria for screening and diagnosis, including primary, secondary and entry screening. There is currently no approved cure for EDV, only supportive and experimental treatment and a currently FDA approved vaccine from Merck  Co's. There are ongoing trials on the following vaccinations: ZMapp, TKM-Ebola, Favipiravir, cAd3, rVSV. LG-ZEBOVGP, REGN-EB3 and mAb- This review article will attempt to summarize the current state of understanding on EVD and explore the most recent and accepted information including the epidemiology of the disease, etiology and pathophysiology, transmission, prevention and control, history, recent outbreaks in West Africa, clinical manifestations, screening and diagnosis, and treatment and clinical trials.", "autors": [{"firstname": "Adekunle", "middlename": "O", "surname": "Sanyaolu1"}, {"firstname": "Chuku", "middlename": "", "surname": "Okorie2"}, {"firstname": "Olanrewaju", "middlename": "",

infected hosts.", "This secretory glycoprotein binds to neutrophil CD16b, which is exclusively expressed by human neutrophils and binds IgG in immune complexes.", "In other words, sGP is responsible for inhibiting early neutrophil activation and may also be responsible for the profound lymphopenia, a unique feature and characteristic of the Ebola infection.", "Thus, studies suggest that sGP plays

are responsible for binding to endothelial cells of an unknown cell receptor but not to neutrophils.", "Therefore, the Ebola virus is known to invade, replicate in, and destroy endothelial cells.", "Destruction of endothelial surfaces is associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and this may contribute to the hemorrhagic manifestations that are seen with late-stage Ebola infections.", "Clinical infection is associated with rapid and extensive viral replication in all tissues and accompanied by widespread and severe focal necrosis.", "The characterization of filovirus

enrolled healthy volunteers between the age of 18 and 50 years.", "Volunteers were placed in two groups of ten each with one group receiving a low dose intramuscular injection of the vaccine and the second group receiving the same vaccine at a higher dosage.", "Blood samples were taken at two and four weeks post vaccination.", "All 20 volunteers generated anti-Ebola antibodies with the levels higher in the group who received the vaccine with the higher dose.", "A second clinical trial was completed in the United Kingdom with 59 participants receiving a single dose of the ChAd3 vaccine at one of three dose levels.", "According to researchers, the ChAd3 monovalent vaccine initiated an immune response.", "Antibody responses on ELISA were performed and showed a 100% response rate in the high-dose group and adverse events were mild and short-lived."], ["The vesicular stomatitis virus vaccines also known as V920 licensed by Merck has been shown to protect against Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus in non-human primates when administered as a single injection.", "It was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory and NewLink Genetics Corporation and was based on a genetically engineered version of the VSV, which in humans rarely produces infections.", "In the vaccination, the VSV gene for the outer protein has been replaced with a segment of the gene for the outer protein of the Zaire Ebola virus species.", "Human testing began in October 2014 and safety results were expected in March 2015.", "In 2018, WHO advisory committee recommended Global Epidemiology of Ebola Disease: A Review of the West African Outbreak the use of Merck's Ebola vaccine in the event of an outbreak.", "V920 was found to be 100 percent effective in protecting against the virus in the late-stage clinical trial.", "A trial is ongoing for the therapeutic cocktail ZMapp.", "This experimental therapy made headlines in August 2014 when it was used to treat two American medical workers who had contracted the Ebola virus.", "The two workers made a complete recovery; however, it is unknown if the recovery was solely from the ZMapp therapy.", "ZMapp includes three monoclonal antibodies combined that were produced in plants, specifically Nicotiana benthamiana.", "Another patient treated with ZMapp in Spain died from the Ebola virus.", "This treatment was found to protect monkeys even after being administered as late as five days following exposure to the Ebola virus.", "Another study combined monoclonal antibodies consisting of 1H3, 2G4, and 4G7 to determine if the post-exposure treatment window could be extended beyond current limits in nonhuman primates.", "It was shown that the combination in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques could suppress viremia up to approximately 105 TCID50, which would lead to survival.", "Other drugs that are being considered for clinical trials include the influenza drug, Favipiravir, which has been approved in Japan to treat pandemic influenza and TKM-Ebola, an RNAi-based drug.", "Two experimental treatments that are working so well and will be offered to all patients in the current Democratic Republic of Congo Ebola outbreak are known as REGN-EB3 and mAb-114.", "The powerful antibody-based treatments made up of cocktails of monoclonal antibodies can cure up to 90% of cases.", "They are infused intravenously into the blood.", "REGN-EB3 is made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals of Tarrytown, N.Y. while Dr. Fauci's institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health, developed mAb114 and licensed production in 2018 to Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, a Miami company.", "The efficacy of the two treatments led to the recommendation of the stoppage of the clinical trial on ZMapp, made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical, and remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences.", "Current treatment for the EVD includes supportive therapy.", "This is challenging in many poor settings because of the limited resources, inadequate infrastructure and lack of personal protective equipment.", "Antibiotics to prevent and/or treat secondary bacterial infections are administered, as well as analgesics, antipyretics and antiemetic drugs.", "Oral rehydration therapy has been preferential over intravenous fluids in order to reduce the risk of transmission.", "Blood products are also used to counteract hemorrhaging in patients and include packed red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma and others.", "Nutritional and psychosocial support as well as anxiety control, is also important in reducing complications of acute illness."]]}, {"title": "CONCLUSION", "sequence": "10.", "paragraphs": [["Since the Ebola virus exists as five different known strains, a complete understanding of the virus has been an

contact or future contact with the individual.", "As there is currently one FDA-approved vaccine and no approved treatments for EVD so far, management of the disease will continue to include supportive therapy to improve recovery.", "This is challenging in many poor settings because of inadequate resources, health personnel, infrastructure, and personal protective equipment.", "Currently,
