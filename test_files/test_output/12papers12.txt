		Background H1N1 influenza continues in the post-pandemic phase as seasonal influenza, after its initial outbreak in Mexico in the year two thousand and nine Annual influenza epidemics result in three five million cases of severe illness and an estimated two hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand deaths each year. Neurological manifestations in influenza infections are diverse and rarely seen. The estimated incidence of influenza-related neurological complications was one point two per one hundred thousand symptomatic pdm09 H1N1 illnesses, as they were observed in four percent  of patients with fatal or severe H1N1 infections in one study; however, more than three-fourth of these cases were in the paediatric age group. There is a considerable overlap between acute cerebellar ataxia and acute cerebellitis as both are characterised by parainfectious, postinfectious, or postvaccination cerebellar inflammation. Cerebellitis cases in H1N1 infection in children have been reported in the form of case series; however, there are few case reports in adults. In the PubMed-based literature review, there were five reported cases of influenza-associated cerebellitis in adults and only two in association with H1N1 pdm09 strain in adults. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case in Pakistan with this presentation in an adult.

		The patient was a previously healthy thirty eight-year-old man having no known comorbid conditions who presented to the Emergency Department of Military Hospital Rawalpindi on three/one/eighteen with a three-day history of fever, cough, sore throat and vomiting. The cough was productive, containing scanty mucoid sputum; fever was high grade associated with rigors and chills. The patient had taken co-amoxiclav but had found no relief. The past medical history was unremarkable. He was a non-smoker, with no recent contact with sick persons and no recent history of immunisation against influenza vaccination. Physical examination revealed that he had a fever of one hundred and two F, blood pressure of one hundred/seventy mm Hg, pulse rate of one hundred and four beats/minute and respiratory rate of twenty four breaths/minute; he was maintaining saturation on room air. The throat was erythematous and congested. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral crepitation. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. The neck was supple, there was no rash noted and no lymph nodes were palpable. Baseline blood count revealed a total leucocyte count of ten thousand, nine hundred/mmthree with neutrophilia, and his renal function tests, electrolytes and liver enzymes were within normal limits. High-resolution computed tomography scan chest showed bilateral patchy consolidations, ground-glass opacities and airspace nodules. He was hospitalised, and the treatment was started on lines of atypical pneumonia with antibiotics and supportive therapy. On day two of admission, the patient developed slow intentional tremors and complained of headache and ABSTRACT Background: Influenza A HoneNone pdm09-associated neurological complications are rare, particularly in adults. This case report highlights one of the uncommon presentations associated with HoneNone pdm09 infection. Case Presentation: We present the case of a thirty eight-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital primarily with respiratory manifestations and developed acute cerebellar ataxia during hospital stay, causing a diagnostic dilemma, as his cerebrospinal fluid analysis and magnetic resonance imaging brain were unremarkable. Throat swab real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction {rRT-PCR) turned out positive for influenza A {HoneNone) pdm09 virus strain and a nontypeable influenza A strain. He showed the resolution of cerebellar signs and a remarkable recovery on oseltamivir therapy. Based on the acute onset, positive RT-PCR and recovery on antiviral, a diagnosis of HoneNone-associated cerebellitis was made. Conclusion: This report highlights an extremely rare complication of influenza infection with only five reported cases in adults and case series in children. Vigilance and a high index of suspicion for patients presenting with rapid onset neurological deterioration during pandemics and seasonal epidemics can prevent devastating sequelae.

There was no associated history of fits or previous history of neurological disease. He had no cognitive or behavioural deficits. Neurological examination revealed GCS fifteen/fifteen, no neck stiffness, intact deep tendon reflexes and bilaterally down going planters. Gait was broad based and ataxic, and he had impaired coordination manifesting as bilateral past pointing, nystagmus, dysdiadochokinesia and dysmetria. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. His cerebrospinal fluid analysis opening pressure was normal, cell count was one cell/mmthree, with occasional lymphocytes, glucose was sixty three mg/dl and total protein was twenty six mg/dl. Gram stain and AFB stain were negative. Urine, sputum and blood cultures were negative for any pathogens. Urine antigen tests for Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma serology were also negative. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies and anti-neuronal profile were negative. Extractable nuclear antigens were also negative. Serum CK levels were one thousand, four hundred and seventy nine you/l. A thorough review of drug intake was made, and drug-induced ataxia was excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging brain with contrast showed no abnormality to guide the diagnosis other than a persistent cavum septum pellucidum and cavum verge which are considered as normal variants.

		A throat swab had been collected and sent to the National Influenza Center, National Institute of Health, Islamabad, for real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The sample was tested based on Center for Disease Control and Prevention rRT-PCR protocol for the detection and characterisation of swine influenza. It was positive for influenza A pdm09 virus strain and a nontypeable influenza A strain. The patient was given a course of oseltamivir seventy five mg twice daily for five days, Intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis and admission to intensive care unit were kept under consideration due to patient s rapid onset of symptoms and sudden deterioration. However, his tremors improved over the next three days and ataxia resolved over the next one week. Based on positive HoneNone RT-PCR and onset of acute cerebellar syndrome, a diagnosis of HoneNoneassociated cerebellitis was made. He had no permanent or residual neurological sequelae and was discharged after a hospital stay of twenty two days. Follow-up neurological examination after three months revealed no residual neurological deficit.

		Acute cerebellitis in adults is a rare entity with a wide range of aetiology, clinical presentation and outcomes. The patient developed neurological symptoms four days after disease onset. The median time from the onset of influenza symptoms to the onset of neurologic symptoms ranges from day one to five and almost all cases had onset of neurologic symptoms within five days of illness onset in one study. Direct invasion and cytokines have been proposed as the likely mechanisms behind acute onset neurological complications, whereas adaptive immune responses in subacute onset. A diagnosis of HoneNone infection requires confirmation by RT-PCR of throat/nasopharyngeal swabs, viral culture, or four-fold rise in new influenza A virus-specific neutralising antibodies. The cerebrospinal fluid patients in another study on INC. In this case, CSF was not tested for viral influenza RT-PCR, whereas it was positive in CSF for one of the HoneNone-associated cerebellitis cases. Although testing CSF for influenza virus RNA may help to establish influenza-associated encephalopathy, a negative PCR does not rule out the diagnosis. In a study by Meijer and others, the influenza virus was detected in CSF of minority of patients. MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality and is used to either confirm a diagnosis or rule out other likely differentials; however, in this case and in other various cases in literature, it was unremarkable. Only forty three percent  had imaging abnormalities in one study, and fifty five percent  of patients had normal imaging studies in a literature review on INC. Regardless of pathogenesis, the most characteristic finding by MRI in cerebellitis is diffuse cortical swelling of the cerebellum which can be complicated in the form of hydrocephalus/tonsillar herniation. Imaging and CSF findings are summarised in Table one. The treatment of acute cerebellitis depends on the aetiology and complications. Antimicrobials and antivirals are the mainstay in infectious aetiologies. When brain MRI shows diffuse cerebellar swelling, patients should also be treated with corticosteroids to prevent further swelling and brain herniation. Surgical interventions such as external ventricular drain might also be required in hydrocephalus. In HoneNone-related neurological complications, antivirals should be ideally started within forty eight hours of the onset of clinical symptoms. The patient s condition also improved after initiation of antiviral. Almost twenty five patients had received antiviral within forty eight hours of hospitalisation in the United States study, but all had received such treatment after neurologic symptoms had begun. Almost half of the patients ended up with neurological sequelae in a review on adult cases of cerebellitis, with cerebellar atrophy given as a plausible explanation for the because. CSF analysis and MRI appear to have a prognostic value in patients with acute onset neurological complications of influenza virus infection. In a study by Meijer and others, all the patients with normal CSF analysis patients with normal MRI made a full recovery. This is consistent with the normal CSF and MRI imaging in this case and the patient s remarkable recovery without any permanent neurological sequelae.  What is new? This case report is based on a rare manifestation of HoneNone two thousand and nine pandemic strain or swine flu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such reported case in an adult in Pakistan; the case highlights the importance of early recognition and treatment of influenza-associated cerebellitis/ acute cerebellar syndrome and gives a brief review of other reported cases in literature.
