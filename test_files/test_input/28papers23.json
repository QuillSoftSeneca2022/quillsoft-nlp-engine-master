West Africa.", "Tests on nine people who came down with a hemorrhagic fever in the northeast of the country confirmed the presence of the virus.", "Three people have died from fever.", "Other samples were being tested, and six people remained hospitalized.", "This is the 8th outbreak to hit the Congo, that s more than any other country.", "The deadly virus was first detected in its dense tropical forests in 1976 in Zaire between September and October.", "The outbreak was more deadly than that earlier reported in Sudan   as result of free migration and poor sanitary measures.", "As a result of laboratory contamination, the infection was also reported in other African regions such as South and East Africa while Philippines, Russia, USA, Viriginia and Pennsylvania were not spared of the infection.", "For now, there has not been any report of Ebola outbreak since WHO has declared DR Congo free of the current outbreak, this review seeks to look at the antecedents of this scourge with a view to address the challenges and the way forward.", "Potential drivers of Ebola viral disease outbreaks Investigation of different EVD outbreaks", "reveals that there are factors that trigger outbreaks and enhance spread of the disease.", "Some of the factors include, epizootic challenges, increasing anthropogenic activity, climate change, inadequate health care practices of some members of the a%icted communities, water and sanitation challenges, burial practices and corpse management capacity in poor-resource settings, porous border sand weak port health services, strong cross-border cultural and socio-economic challenges.", "These are common variables not only for Ebola affected countries but other nations that are at risk of emerging infectious diseases.", "Not well identified environmental conditions are more favorable for survival.", "Studies conducted using satellite telemetry have shown that during periods of low fruit abundance in the equatorial forest, large colonies of fruit bats migrate long distances to take advantage of fruit pulses in other regions of the continent.", "Stopovers during migration have been noted in certain regions of Uganda and DRC where major outbreaks of EVD have occurred.", "These stopovers observed in the migratory activity of the fruit bats provide a unique opportunity for local populations to massively hunt bats, either for food or commercial purposes that places the mat great risk of zoonotic infections.", "In 2007, outbreak of EVD in DRC was traced to massive bat hunting due to an influx of fruit bats in the Occidental Kasai Province during a peak fruit season.", "Similarly, the current West African outbreak is traceable to hunting of two species of bats: Hypsignathus monstrosus and Epomops franqueti that are believed to have migrated from Central Africa http://www.theguardian.", "This claim was supported by molecular investigation, which indicates that the causative agent of the West African outbreak diverged from the Central African ZEBOV strain about a decade ago.", "Similarly, antibodies against ZEBOV have been detected in migratory bats in distant geographical areas, including Bangladesh and Ghana, indicating the potential of Central African migratory fruit bats to introduce the virus into other geographical areas.", "Clearly, the effects of climate change on the migration of fruit bats, particularly from their ecological niches in the equatorial forest of Central Africa to other geographical areas, may have a future global health consequence.", "This is because there is a potential of migratory fruit bats, which are known to harbor over 66 viruses and introduce deadly viruses into different geographic areas.", "Indeed, there are global concerns that these animal-borne viruses may trigger a broad range of emerging infectious diseases in future."]]}, {"title": "Ebola virulence experience in each outbreak", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["The average Ebola virulence is about

outbreak in history according to records.", "However, it is not still regarded as the most fatal, although it claimed the highest death toll and accounted for 44% of recorded cases.", "It has only killed 55% of infected persons and hence painted orange on the chart.", "With a case fatality rate of 90%indicated as, the epidemic of 2003 in Congo referred to as outbreak 14; it is known as the most virulent up to date painted red on this chart.", "Whether something is deadly is usually defined by the likelihood of dying from it, not the total number it kills.", "The 2003 Ebola epidemic is the deadliest outbreak based on the interpretation of the word deadly which in general term is defined by the likelihood of victims dying from such disease or the total number it that dies from it.", "The Uganda scenario is labeled as the least virulent outbreak which occurred in 2007.", "Its fatality rate was 25% and is given yellow colour on this chart.", "Nevertheless, the most and least virulent outbreaks leave out three cases of 100% fatality in which each claimed the life of one person and an outbreak where the only infected person did not die from the onslaught.", "This is therefore given as red and yellow lines found in the top-left corner.", "Ebola was first reported in 1976 with two simultaneous outbreaks.", "The first one took place in Sudan and claimed the lives of 53%.", "The second outbreak known as the 3rd largest and has the 2nd highest virulence rate of 88% labeled with red color on this chart.", "The Ebola virus disease was named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo which was the site of this outbreak.", "Methodology", "The literature search used by the authors for this review was based on keywords of the thrust of the paper, therefore search terms such as Ebola Virus Disease, Ebola antecedents, Ebola outbreak, Clinical syndromes, Treatments, Prevention and Control in West Africa were used.", "Literature search on cross-sectional, observational and randomized control studies published on the Ebola between 1976 and 2017 provided main sources of information.", "All these were obtained from the commonly used

infected persons.", "Epidemiologic observations have demonstrated that chimpanzees were the source of one human case in two previously described outbreaks in Co te d Ivoire in 1994 and Gabon in 1996.", "Transmission through inanimate objects contaminated with infected bodily fluids has also been reported while the principal mode of transmission in human outbreaks is human-to-human transmission through direct contact SMGr up Copyright Olayiwola JO with a symptomatic or dead EVD case or with contaminated surfaces and materials.", "In the early stage of human disease, the risk for transmission is lower but viral loads in blood and secretions increase so rapidly during the course of illness, with the highest levels of virus shedding noticed very late during the course of illness of severely ill patients.", "Nevertheless, handling of dead bodies during burial ceremonies plays an important role in transmission.", "Augmented transmission takes place in hospitals involving nearly one quarter of cases occurring among health care workers.", "Ebola virus can also infects human, non-human primates and some other mammalian regarded as host, but reservoir of Ebola viruses was for a long period in latent form.", "However, intensive efforts were expended to identify the natural reservoir.", "Some researchers previously suggested that rodents and bats could play vital role as reservoir animals of EBOV.", "The detection of antibodies and viral RNA in three bats species was the first verification about EBOV infected bats and this was a proof that bats are involved in circulation of EBOV in nature.", "Ebola virus transmission to humans in sub-Saharan Africa was believed to be the contact with dead or living infected animals, although some reports have linked the cases to the skinning and butchering of carcasses.", "In previous outbreaks, hunting and butchering of chimpanzee including fruit bats have been known as a potential source of Ebola infection.", "According to a report Leroy and others, the human outbreaks is made up of multiple simultaneous epidemics resulting from different viral strains, and each epidemic came as a result of the handling of a distinct gorilla, chimpanzee, or duiker carcass.", "In this regard, surveillance of wildlife health and monitoring of their mortality may help to envisage and prevent subsequent Ebola outbreaks."]]}, {"title": "Replication of Ebola Virus", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["Life cycle and pathogenicity of Ebola virus in humans:", "Ebola virus negative RNA virus from the family

an anti-inflammatory attribute for the duration of infection which further helps EBOV to escape response from host immune system.", "Nevertheless, sGP possesses many comparable epitopes with GP", "and so it could have potential to sequester or absorb host Abs in order to block their downstream action.", "Hence, the viral proteins disrupt various components of the immune system in order to bind to the host cell for consequent entry.", "and most enveloped viruses use a general mechanism to infect host cells referred to endocytosis.", "However, the exact mechanism for which EBOV enters host cells still remains a mirage.", "Reports have it that EBOV makes use of a lipid-dependent, non-clathrin and dynaminindependent endocytic pathway of entry of which Macropinocytosis remains the most likely mechanism employed by the EBOV.", "Macropinocytosis involves outward extensions of the plasma membrane formed by actin polymerization, which could fold back upon them.", "The formation of a macriopinosome is as a result of the distal loop ends of these extensions or membrane ru%es can fuse together.", "This also indicates that actin and its associated polymerising proteins play a major role in virus entry but the exact mechanism through which EBOV induces macropinocytosis is still not clear.", "It is however suggested that interactions between GP and host cell surface receptors could trigger macropinocytosis to begin viral entry.", "Virus replication:", "EBOV commences transcription at the leader end of the genome with the binding of the polymerase complex immediately after gaining entry into the host cell.", "The gene VP30 is an important transcription activation factor used for the transcription viral genome while VP24 acts as an inhibitor transcription process.", "The
