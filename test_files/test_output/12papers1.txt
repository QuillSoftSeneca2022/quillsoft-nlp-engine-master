		A swine flu pandemic hit the world and India was no exception. Many deaths were reported in metropolitan cities. Knowledge about the infection is an important element of control of the infection. Method This cross sectional survey was conducted at a tertiary care centre hospital where the patients are referred from different parts of Haryana accompanied by relatives therefore it was regarded as a potentially high-risk area for the spread of Influenza A and chosen to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice in relation to swine flu. A self administered questionnaire involved forty two hospital staff members accompanying the patients from 1st September two thousand and nine to 15th October two thousand and nine. Results Out of all respondents only twenty five percent  had heard of swine flu before and out of which sixty five percent  HS and thirty seven percent  GP knew more than three correct symptoms. There were eighty six percent  respondents who thought that touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands can spread the disease. Altogether eighty percent  respondents thought that the disease was controllable while, nearly ninety two percent  of respondents knew about the nearest swine flu control or testing centre. Among all hardly ten percent  had attended some type of awareness program for swine flu control and sixty two percent  were taking precautions against the spread of swine flu. Nearly seventy percent  of respondents thought that masks prevent the disease while about ninety eight percent  washed their hands before having meal. Nearly seventy two percent  of this knowledge was from television and twenty percent  from newspapers.

		Swine flu, knowledge, attitude, practices, medical staff Background Swine Flu pandemic detected in April two thousand and nine contained a combination of genes from swine, avian, and human influenza viruses.1,2 The outbreak began in Mexico, with evidence that there had been an ongoing epidemic for months before it was officially recognized as such. The virus continued to spread globally, and the World Health Organization in June declared the outbreak to be a pandemic4 and raised a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short. As of six August two thousand and nine, the World Health Organization reported one hundred and seventy seven thousand, four hundred and fifty seven laboratory confirmed cases of influenza A/H1N1 and one thousand, four hundred and sixty two deaths. India was no exception and many deaths   were reported in metropolitan cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore. Given the seriousness of the situation and lack of any specific vaccine against Influenza A, mitigation measures in the India have so far focused on identifying, treating, and isolating people who have the disease and educating the public about the steps that individuals can take to reduce the risk of transmission. These recommendations include using tissues when sneezing, washing hands regularly with soap and water. The media, including both televised and written media, and to a lesser extent the radio and the internet, where free uncensored writing and you-tube postings take place had led to inappropriate behaviour by the public such as; refusal to comply with precautionary measures, including wearing a mask or accepting a vaccination; avoidance of certain activities including visiting the hospital due to fear of healthcare facilities as a venue for acquiring the infection.8-ten There was a large need for the dissemination of accurate information to overcome the misinformed dialogue taking place on TV, newspapers and internet. eleven During a pandemic, public health agencies can play critical roles in controlling the spread of disease. Therefore the present study was designed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice during swine flu epidemic among the medical staff and the general population.

	Title: Knowledge response
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Out of all respondents only twenty five percent  had heard of swine flu before. Out of these twenty five percent  hospital staff knew about symptoms of swine flu. Sixty five percent of HS and thirty seven percent of GP knew more than three correct symptoms. sixty five percent  of HS and seventy four percent  of GP thought that this was a disease of children and elderly patients, while thirty five percent  of HS and twenty two percent  of GP thought that adults with co morbidities like asthma and diabetes were at a greater risk and only two percent  of GP didn t know about it. There were ninety five percent  HS and eighty six percent  general people who thought that touching of eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands can spread the disease while only five percent  HS and ten percent  GP thought that it was partially true and six point six six  percent  of GP didn t know the answer. Altogether, eighty percent  of HS and GP thought that the disease was controllable while, fifteen percent  of HS and ten percent  of GP thought that it was not and ten percent  of GP didn t know the answer. Nearly ninety five percent  of HS and ninety two percent  of GP knew about the nearest swine flu control or testing centre and half of HS were aware of the second wave of swine flu epidemic but seventy two percent  of GP were not aware of it.

	Title: Attitude response
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Only ten percent  of HS and GP had attended some type of awareness program for swine flu control. Nearly sixty five percent  did not avoid public gatherings like parties and group meetings of the fear of swine flu while rest thirty five percent  avoid such meetings. Nearly seventy percent  of respondents definitely thought that mask prevents the disease and twenty percent  thought that it was partially true and only ten percent    didn t know the answer.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Practice response About ninety eight percent  respondents wash their hands before having meals. sixty two percent    were not taking any precautions. Disposal of mask was done by throwing them into the dustbin by thirty four percent  while, disposal by burning was done by twenty percent. However, forty six percent  did not know how to dispose masks. Of the respondents forty six percent  thought that it was not safe to reuse the mask more than once and three point three three percent  general population thought that this was partially true while forty percent  respondents did not knew the answer and twelve percent  answered that mask can be reused. There were ninety four percent  of respondents who thought that if they had developed the symptoms of swine flu then they would have contacted the swine flu centre immediately for diagnosis while only ten percent  hospital staff thought that they would have taken the proper precautions to prevent the spread of disease and five percent  of HS thought that they would have done both. Nearly ninety four percent  respondents used tissue or handkerchief while sneezing or coughing and when the respondents had to visit some swine flu infected area then forty percent  wash their hands with soap and water more frequently and thoroughly while forty percent  respondents avoid contact with the people who appeared sick and thirty percent  followed the both precautions. Discussion In spite of the increase in the number of Influenza A cases as well as the response of the WHO by raising its pandemic alert status to phase six and extensive media coverage, public responses to Influenza A were muted. In practice, convincing the public that the threat is real is often a more pressing task for public health agencies than providing reassurance. seven Many reports have examined the various levels of knowledge about infectious agents and public behavior in relation to these infections; such studies have primarily focused on the SARS and avian influenza outbreaks. eight hundred and thirteen Other studies have been recently published specifically on behavioral and attitudinal responses to pandemic two thousand and nine Influenza.ten,   In our study nearly seventy five percent  of the respondents had never heard of the swine flu before out of which ninety nine point three three percent  were of general population and only 0.sixseven percent  were of medical staff. Out of which fifty two percent  knew more than three symptoms. In another study by Kamate et al eighty three percent  of subjects had heard about swine flu. In another study forty four percent  of national sample of adult Australians reported having knowledge of the term pandemic influenza,18 a finding similar to that of a study conducted in the USA in two thousand and six in which forty one percent  of respondents had previously heard of this term. So here we conclude that our respondents have far less knowledge about swine flu than the above studies and the reason may be lack of public health communications.

		In our study nearly seventy two  percent  of respondents learned about swine flu from television while about twenty percent  came to know about the disease in newspapers and only eight percent  through word of mouth. Similarly in an another study the majority of the participants received their information about swine flu from the television; fifty one point one percent  received information from written media such as newspapers and magazines, while forty eight point two percent  received information from the internet.

		In a recent review of behavioural responses to influenza pandemics in the 20th century,20 the only two measures that had strong support by scientific literature to lessen the spread of the diseases were hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. School closure and screening of travellers had reduced the use of public transportation; seventy four point three percent  had not taken any time off work; However, more than half the respondents avoided crowded places and fifty four point six percent  washed their hands with soap and water more often than usual, and sixty three point six percent  were not overtly worried about cleaning or disinfecting things that they might touch.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Nearly seventy percent  of the respondents believed that using masks definitely prevents swine flu while twenty percent  were not sure whether masks could prevent from the disease and ten percent  didn t knew the answer. Nearly thirty four percent  disposed the used mask by throwing it into dustbin, twenty percent  disposed them by burning and forty six percent  did not know how to dispose the masks. In another study the willingness to wear a mask during a pandemic was surprisingly high, particularly as this is not common practice in Australia. Use of masks by the general public in China, Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, during the two thousand and three severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak was below this level.

		Eighty percent of our respondents definitely thought that the disease was controllable while ten percent  thought that this was partially true while in an another study two percent of the respondents were of the opinion that Influenza A would not affect their health; thirty six point four percent  feared that they would be somewhat affected; thirty four point five percent  believed that they would be seriously affected; and twenty seven point one percent  had no idea about the effect of Influenza A on their health. legal and ethical consequences when implemented. While the other four measures, including isolation and wearing of a surgical mask or an N95 mask, had cost effectiveness concerns and would be difficult to implement over long periods of time.21, twenty two Maximum of the respondents thought that swine flu can be spread by poor hygiene like touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands and actually ninety eight percent  of respondents washed their hands before meals while nearly ninety four percent  use tissue or handkerchief while coughing or sneezing. In another study nearly, one-third reported avoiding touching their eyes, nose, or mouth and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. However, only onefourth of participants reported throwing the tissue in the trash after use and avoiding normal activities if they have flulike symptoms zero point one seven

		It is important to know what proportion of the population is concerned about contracting a disease since those who are concerned would be expected to take more precautions. In a telephone-assisted survey of two thousand and eighty one adults above the age of sixteen years, the New South Wales Department of Health found that only forty eight point three percent  of those interviewed were willing to comply with precautionary measures.23,24 In our study nearly sixty six percent  responded that they did not avoid public gatherings like parties or group meetings but forty percent  of the respondents washed their hand with soap and water thoroughly and more frequently when they visit swine flu infected areas while, forty percent  avoided close contact with the people who appeared unwell. In another study fifty nine point five percent  had not cancelled or postponed any social event; sixty seven point six percent  had not
