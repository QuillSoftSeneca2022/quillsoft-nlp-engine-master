{"title": "Ecology of Ebolavirus: A Review of Current Knowledge, Speculations and Future Research Directions", "abstract": "Ebola virus disease, which emerged in West Africa in March  infected about  people resulting in the death of over  people. After the discovery of the Ebola virus in  over  outbreaks have been reported. The / outbreak, started in Guinea in March  spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, with few cases in other countries including Nigeria, Senegal and Mali, and isolated cases in Europe and US. Though there have been no approved/licensed drugs or preventive vaccines, some therapies and vaccines, which have entered phase  clinical trials, have shown promising results. This virus emerges and re-emerges sporadically. Hence, the aim of this review is to assess the ecology of the virus with the view of understanding the ecological basis for the emergence and re-emergence of the virus. Bats are thought to be the primary/reservoir hosts of the ebolavirus, great apes the possible intermediate hosts, and humans the end hosts. But it also appears that decomposers and scavengers such as insects, rodents and other animals could possibly play a role in the spread and sustenance of ebolavirus in the forest ecosystem. Climate change and human activities such as urbanization, deforestation, agricultural intensification, hunting and consumption of wildlife, which disturb forest ecosystems, may have contributed to the sporadic emergence of the virus.", "autors": [{"firstname": "Elijah", "middlename": "Ige", "surname": "Ohimain1"}], "blocks": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["TFiloviruses", "particularly Ebola and Marburg viruses causes deadly hemorrhagic fevers in humans and non-human primates particularly the great apes.", "Ebola virus disease, which is also known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever is caused by Ebola virus, which has a case fatality rate of up to 90%.", "Ebola virus is among the most dangerous microorganisms today.", "It has been classified as Category A biothreat pathogen.", "Ebola and Marburg virus have been linked to several sporadic outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever especially in East and Central Africa.", "Ebolavirus has been described as pathogen causing emerging and re-emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks in humans.", "There are indicators that the frequency, scale and severity of outbreaks are increasing.", "For nearly 40 years, the science community has been researching on Ebola virus.", "Recent findings suggest that outbreaks of Ebola virus might not just be sporadic as previously thought, but could be linked to changes in ecology that brought humans in close proximity to natural / primary host and immediate hosts of Ebola virus due to human exploitation of previously unoccupied forest ecosystems.", "Ebola virus was first discovered in 1976 with twin simultaneous outbreaks in Nzara, south Sudan and Yambuku, Zaire now Democratic Republic of Congo, while Marburg virus was discovered in 1967 in Germany and Yogoslavia, where the virus was first isolated from African green Monkeys imported from Uganda.", "The 2014/2015 Ebola virus disease outbreak started in Guinea in the Gueckedon region from where it spread to neighboring countries i.e. Sierra Leone and Liberia.", "The suspected index case was a 2 year old boy who possibly became infected on 6 December, 2013, and on 22 March 2014, the World Health Organization officially declared Ebola outbreak in Guinea.", "Soon the disease spread to other countries including Liberia, with minor cases in Nigeria all in West Africa and few imported cases to other countries including US and Mali.", "While ebolavirus was rapidly curtailed in other countries it persisted for longer periods in the three West African countries where the epidemic started.", "At the end of December 2014, over 20, 000 EVD cases have been reported with nearly 50% fatality.", "A total 27,988 persons have been infected worldwide with the following breakdown in the three main countries;
