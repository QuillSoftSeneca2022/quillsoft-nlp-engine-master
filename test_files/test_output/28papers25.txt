Title: ,QWHUQDWLRQDO-RXUQDORI+\JLHQHDQG [[[ [[[ Understanding the effect of socio-economic characteristics and psychosocial factors on household water treatment practices in rural Nepal using Bayesian Belief Networks
/***********************************************************************/
Abstract: About twenty Million people in Nepal still do not have access to safely managed drinking water service and twenty two million do not treat their drinking water before consumption. Few studies have addressed the combination of socio-economic characteristics and psychosocial factors that explain such behaviour in a probabilistic manner. In this paper we present a novel approach to assess the usage of household water treatment, using data from four hundred and fifty one households in mid and far-western rural Nepal. We developed a Bayesian belief network model that integrates socio-economic characteristics and five psychosocial factors. The socio-economic characteristics of households included presence of young children, having been exposed to HWT promotion in the past, level of education, type of water source used, access to technology and wealth level. The five psychosocial factors capture households perceptions of incidence and severity of water-borne infections, attitudes towards the impact of poor water quality on health, water treatment norms and the knowledge level for performing HWT. We found that the adoption of technology was influenced by the psychosocial factors norms, followed by the knowledge level for operating the technology. Education, wealth level, and being exposed to the promotion of HWT were the most influential socio-economic characteristics. Interestingly, households who were connected to a piped water scheme have a higher probability of HWT adoption compared to other types of water sources. The scenario analysis revealed that interventions that only target single socio-economic characteristics do not effectively boost the probability of HWT practice. However, interventions addressing several socio-economic characteristics increase the probability of HWT adoption among the target groups.

		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Access to potable water is still a global challenge.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Household water treatment, which treats water at the point of use such as boiling and ceramic filtration, is one possible means to tackle the challenge of non-potable water at household level. Despite its many advantages, very few studies related to WASH, such as understanding hand pump functionality in Africa, have used BBN models. This approach therefore remains underexplored in understanding WASH-related behaviour, as found in two reviews of BBN applications in water science and management.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		We present a WASH related cross-sectional survey of rural communities in the mid and far-western regions of Nepal. An analysis of the interactions between socio-economic characteristics and psychosocial factors, and the impact of these interactions on the adoption of HWT through the lens of the simplified RANAS model. BBN was used to estimate the probability of HWT adoption, while considering the combinations of socio-economic and psychosocial variables.

	Title: Study setting and data source
	Sequence: 2.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		In October two thousand and fourteen a cross-sectional study was conducted during which five hundred and twelve households were surveyed within five Village Development Committees, which are the smallest administrative unit in Nepal. The five VDCs were located in different districts in two provinces : Province Karnali Pradesh: Jarbuta VDC in Surkhet district, Nepa VDC in Dailekh district, and Sima VDC in Jajarkot district; and Province Sudurpashchim Pradesh: Birpath VDC in Achham district and Pahalmanpur VDC in Kailali district. Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation, a non-profit organization based in Switzerland, sought this research collaboration to rigorously investigate WASH practices within its service area in the five districts described above. For the study of WASH practices, data collection involved semistructured face-to-face household interviews. The questionnaires were translated into Nepali, back-translated into English, and reviewed for accuracy. A pilot test was conducted before the field research. Informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the interview. This baseline study was part of a WASH project initiated by Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation which was approved by Department of Water supply and Sewerage Nepal. Study households were randomly selected for enrolment in a twostep randomization process: first, within each VDC, wards (sub-level of, QWHUQDWLRQDO-RXUQDORI+\JLHQHDQG [[[ [[[ D.

		VDC) were randomly selected after a participatory social mapping of the VDC with community members based on the population of the wards. Second, households were randomly selected within the selected wards through a transect-walk and enrolment of every two or three houses. The target participants were women who are the primary caregivers in the households. The questionnaire covers household information, information on water access, WASH knowledge, perception, water related behaviour, health status, and market information. A five-item Likert scale was used to measure each behavioural determinant factor. Socio-economic characteristics were measured on a nominal scale. The respondent's answer to this question was used as the outcome variable: Do you use any method to treat your drinking water? .

	Title: RANAS psychosocial factors
	Sequence: 2.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		The RANAS model consists of five psychosocial factors: risk, attitude, norm, ability, and self-regulation. Risk factors indicate an individual's understanding and perception of health risk. Attitude factors represent a person's belief towards the behaviour, such as positive or negative opinions about the costs and benefits. Norm factors represent which behaviours are perceived to be normal and abnormal. Ability factors relate to an individual's perception in his or her ability to execute the behaviour. Finally, self-regulation represents factors that are responsible for the continuation and maintenance of certain behaviour, such as commitment. More details can be found in S1. Since RANAS requests the information at the sub-factor level of psychosocial factors, Principal Component Analysis on the sub-factors was performed to simplify the BBN structure and the first principle component, where possible, was used to represent each RANAS factor. The data were analysed in IBM SPSS twenty three PCA was conducted only on the two psychosocial factors: risk and norm. The PCA on factor risk yielded two dominant components: Component one named perceived severity, was mostly influenced by variables perceived severity on life and perceived severity on a child under five years, and Component two named perceived infection probability, was mostly influenced by perceived vulnerability and health knowledge. The PCA on the sub-factors norm yielded one dominant component. The component scores were then divided into three levels based on the score: one-third of the lowest score as low, the next one-third as moderate, and the rest as high. The new factors were then used in the BBN analysis. We lost information on the sub-factors of attitude, ability and selfregulation due to coding error. Therefore PCA was not be conducted on these variables. The psychosocial factor attitude was represented by its sub-factor beliefs about health benefits and the factor ability was represented by the sub-factor how-to-perform knowledge. We scaled these factors into the three categories: low, moderate and high, in order to keep the CPTs of the BBN model parsimonious and understandable. We had to further simplify the model by removing the RANAS factor self-regulation from the analysis because only about thirty percent  of the total cases had answered to the corresponding question. Such simplification does not, QWHUQDWLRQDO-RXUQDORI+\JLHQHDQG [[[ [[[ D. Daniel, and others undermine the conclusion that are drawn later. That is because selfregulation is hard to measure in households who do not perform the behaviour, i.e., we had only twenty two percent  respondents who practiced HWT.

	Title: Socio-economic characteristics
	Sequence: 2.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Eight socio-economic characteristics were identified from literature that may influence the psychosocial factors level of education WASH HWT. The respondents were then divided into three groups: poor; according to their scores. For the analysis, we removed sixty one data cases that did not contain information on the current practice of treating water. Thus, a total of four hundred and fifty one cases from five hundred and twelve households were analysed. The answer do not know was coded as an empty value to simplify the categories in the analysis. Furthermore, we categorized the study locations in our study into easy logistic access and diffi cult logistic access.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Performing the BBN model Four aspects were considered when building the BBN structure: statistical relationship between the socio-economic factors and psychosocial factors, the complexity of the model. The ten-fold cross-validation was used, using the same software, to judge how robust calibrated CPTs are, by first calibrating them on a subset of data and using the calibrated model in prediction mode on the remaining data to judge model's performance. In our case, ninety percent  of the dataset was randomly selected to impute the CPT and the remaining ten percent  was then used to validate the performance of the calibrated model. Since the calibration and validation subsets were randomly selected, the process was repeated ten times and the average of validation performances was taken as the cross ten-fold cross validation score. Another performance that was considered was Receiver Operating Characteristics. The ROC graph plots the sensitivity on the Y axis and false positive on the X axis. The value of the area under the ROC curve is used to assess model performance. The closer the AUC value is to one the better is its performance. Parameter sensitivity analysis of the input node was performed to identify the nodes that most influence the output node. We utilized the algorithm within the Genie software which calculates the effect of small changes in the CPT of each node on the output node. Finally, we simulated the interventions by exploiting the predictive strength of BBN, i.e., Bayesian inference. Updating the beliefs of socio-economic nodes updates, first, the likelihood values of psychosocial nodes, and thereafter the outcome node. For example, updating HWT promotion to one hundred percent  yes, increased the probability of four psychosocial nodes being high that were connected to it: severity, infection probability, attitude, and ability, then increased the probability of using HWT from eighteen percent  to twenty percent.

		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		The questionnaire results show that only twenty two percent  of all the respondents treated their water. About fifty seven percent  of the respondents obtained water from piped community taps and twenty seven percent  from a tube well. About half of the respondents had at least one child below the age of five Only ten cases of a household having a family member experiencing diarrhea in the last two days were reported during the survey. Forty-five percent of the respondents reported having no education. Detail information can be found in Table S3.

		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Lay-out of the BBN model Fig. three showed the final structure that had the best model performance, while it kept the number of links between the socio-economic characteristics and psychosocial factors to a minimum. The BBN model predicted a use of HWT of eighteen percent  considering information in all nodes, which was slightly different from the real percentage of HWT use. We did not include variable diarrhea cases in the model because it did not have a statistically significant relationship with any of the psychosocial factors and the proportion of diarrhea cases was only two point four percent  in the dataset. Furthermore, we included HWT promotion rather than WASH promotion in the model since it had a more statistically significant relationship with other psychosocial factors.

		The overall model accuracy to predict the output was eighty three point six five percent. Its success in predicting the output no, i.e., it could distinguish between the adopters and non-adopters of HWT suffi ciently well. , QWHUQDWLRQDO-RXUQDORI+\JLHQHDQG [[[ [[[ D. Daniel, and others Parameter sensitivity analysis Fig. four shows the maximum values of the derivatives of posterior probability distributions of the output node, taken in relation to the entries of the CPT of a node. For example, node education had a corresponding value of seven percent, which means that there was one entry in the prior probability table of education, which when perturbed by one percent of its current value caused a maximum seven percent change in the probability of HWT adoption. Changing other entries in that node gave derivative values lower than zero point zero seven The sensitivity analysis shows that among socio-economic characteristics, education was the most sensitive node, followed by wealth level, and received HWT promotion in the past. The nodes severity and norm were the most sensitive nodes among psychosocial factors. However, from the sensitivity analysis, we considered that there were no single highly sensitive socio-economic or psychosocial nodes that highly affect the output node.

		whether the respondents received HWT promotion or not, while the presence of children under five years did not change the likelihood of HWT adoption. Another observation is that easily accessible areas such as Kailali, had a higher probability of using HWT. The psychosocial factors norm and ability played an important role in influencing the likelihood of using HWT. Moreover, the more households perceived severity and infection probability, the higher was their probability to use HWT. Additionally, the psychosocial factors realizing the health benefits of doing HWT, social pressure, and know howto -perform HWT all significantly influenced the adoption of HWT.

	Title: Scenarios analysis to increase the probability of HWT adoption
	Sequence: 3.3.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Bayesian inference was used only to simulate potential interventions but also to understand how the system works. For example, updating node education. The more educated the person is, the higher level of ability and attitude obtained. Surprisingly, the analysis showed that education level had an inverse effect on perceived infection probability, with more education resulting in a lower level of perceived infection. Further, even if a household is located in easily accessible parts of rural Nepal, a higher rate of HWT adoption was only possible when such households were able to afford HWT technology and had received promotion activities. Finally, we found that households with a toddler, consisting of educated and relatively wealthy persons, who were aware of and have easy access to HWT products, and with piped water connections are most likely, with fifty seven percent  likelihood compared to eighteen percent  in the baseline, to adopt HWT. Fig. five illustrates this causal interpretation and how the value in the all psychosocial nodes being high increased compared to the baseline.

	Title: Discussion

		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		The presented model illustrates the causal linkages between socioeconomic characteristics, psychosocial factors, and adoption of HWT. Furthermore, due to its graphical representation of BBN models, it facilitates the communication of information to people without a Empty boxes means that the value of that node did not change or was similar to the baseline condition. , QWHUQDWLRQDO-RXUQDORI+\JLHQHDQG [[[ [[[ D. Daniel, and others technical abilities so they can participate better in the decision making process. The BBNs presented in this paper combined both quantitative and qualitative approaches to facilitate the effective design of interventions in the WASH domain. By analysing the interactions between combinations of variables in a probabilistic manner, the BBN model predicted the likelihood of different scenarios on the adoption of HWT in the study area. However, this has not been done in previous WASH-related behavioural studies that mainly used approaches different from BBN, e.g., logistic regression. This was also confirmed in the work of Rogers on diffusion of innovations theory, which stated that individuals should have enough how-to-perform knowledge before they are expected to try the innovations. Although previous studies have also found specific psychosocial factors responsible for the adoption of HWT, a major result of our study is that the change of one psychosocial factor is not enough to boost the adoption of HWT, i.e., greater than fifty percent  for the specific case of rural Nepal. It suggests that targeting multiple psychosocial factors is necessary to effectively change the behaviour in water treatment. It is surprising to see that node education have a different effect on various psychosocial nodes. In the case of our study, education positively influenced the HWT adoption not via perceived infection probability, but via attitude and ability. Cross-tabulation of the sub-factors separately showed that households with higher education perceived slightly lower vulnerability and factual knowledge. This perhaps is because of implicit bias that educated households have in believing that they know more than they actually do. This advantage, i.e., to visualize the effect of changes one variable on all related variables at once, is one unique aspect of the BBN model that sets it apart from other approaches, such as logistic regression. We could simulate and learn the pattern of how socio-economic characteristics influence people's perceptions and then drive the behaviour. In other words, socio-economic characteristics enable us to understand the system behind the practice of HWT.

	Title: Implications
	Sequence: 4.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Our research revealed that there were critical combinations of certain socio-economic characteristics that facilitated the adoption of HWT through corresponding psychosocial factors. These findings can be used for targeting specific groups when designing HWT, QWHUQDWLRQDO-RXUQDORI+\JLHQHDQG [[[ [[[ D. Daniel, and others interventions and prioritizing the transformation of non-adopters to improve, i.e., the households with socio-economic characteristics that correspond to high probability of adopting HWT. These households might then be categorized as earlier adopters, establishing a distribution network to ensure easier access to HWT products and information for key target groups assessing target households' willingness and ability to pay for cleaner water prior to procurement of HWT products. Fig. five shows the ultimate intervention which addresses all the socio-economic characteristics nodes. Furthermore, our model showed that the combination of the provision of products plus effective promotion activities were better than the provision of products or promotion alone. Some interventions in other studies gave the HWT products away for free or at a subsidised price because HWT are marginally expensive for some households. This income effect was interpreted by our model through wealth level being rich and logistic access being easy. However, as suggested by a previous study on the use of toilet in Terai area, Nepal, the subsidies have to reach poor households. If a non-subsidised program is chosen, the implementers should think about right strategies for self-financed toilets, e.g., by providing microloans. This study underlines some limitations and remarks for the future work. First, this study did not distinguish between different types of HWT promotion activities that respondents received in the past. Previous longitudinal studies revealed that different types of HWT promotion activities resulted in different levels of HWT adoption which is worth modelling in the next study. Second, we also suggest validating the model in other locations to examine how generalizable the CPTs are, especially CPTs corresponding to psychosocial factors node conditional on socioeconomic characteristics, and how they might change across contexts. RANAS suggests that psychosocial factors can have different influence on behaviour depending on the situation or location. Third, due to missing values on certain sub-factors in our datasets, the representative psychosocial factors used in this model may not fully reflect the complete meaning of each RANAS factor. Future studies should incorporate all RANAS factors and see how it can better explain the HWT adoption. Even though we argue that targeting multiple psychosocial factors is still the key to increase the adoption rate of HWT, especially when the adoption rate in that area is very low. Fourth, we did not explore attitudes of households towards different HWT methods because the scope of the study was to explore general attitudes towards HWT practice and not to compare different HWT methods. Further, such an assessment would also not have been reliable because most of the respondents only used boiling as a HWT method. Fifth, future studies should investigate our assumption that socio-economic characteristics indirectly influence the use of HWT via psychosocial factors. Lastly, the data of the HWT use was respondent's self-reported HWT practice, which might have been over-reported and could have been subject to bias.

	Title: Conclusion
	Sequence: 5.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		The causal relationship between socio-economic factors, psychosocial factors, and WASH-related behaviour have not been investigated in-depth in previous studies. In this paper, we showed how socio-economic characteristics influence the psychosocial factors of people in rural Nepal and how those psychosocial factors work together in determining households adoption of HWT, while visualising and quantifying their interactions through a BBN model. The findings presented here highlight the complex system underlying HWT adoption. The most important drivers of HWT adoption among individual socio-economic variables were education, wealth level, and HWT promotion, while social norm, and ability to perform the behaviour were influential psychosocial conditions. The presented method is also helpful in setting priorities in behavioural change interventions in the WASH domain, first by observing the socio-economic characteristics of HWT adopter, and also by assessing the combinations of psychosocial factors that can increase the probability of HWT adoption. The results also suggest that the piped water supply project in LMICs is a potential entry point for the high likelihood of HWT adoption, if it is accompanied by other activities as described in this study.
