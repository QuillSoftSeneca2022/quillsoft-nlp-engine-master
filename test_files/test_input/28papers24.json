{"title": "of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Asymptomatic Orthopoxvirus Circulation in Humans in the Wake of a Monkeypox Outbreak among Chimpanzees in Cameroon", "abstract": "Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus that causes smallpox-like illness in humans. In Cameroon, human monkeypox cases were confrmed in  and outbreaks in captive chimpanzees occurred in  and  We investigated the OPXV serological status among staff at a primate sanctuary   and residents from nearby villages, and describe contact with possible monkeypox reservoirs. We focused specifcally on Gambian rats because it is a recognized possible reservoir and because contact with this species was common enough to render suffcient statistical power. We collected one -mL whole blood specimen from each participant to perform a generic anti-OPXV ELISA test for IgG and IgM antibodies and administered a questionnaire about prior symptoms of monkeypox-like illness and contact with possible reservoirs. Our results showed evidence of OPXV exposures among some of those too young to have received smallpox vaccination. No participants reported prior symptoms consistent with monkeypox. After adjusting for the education level, participants who frequently visited the forest were more likely to have recently eaten Gambian rats and primate sanctuary staff were less likely to have touched or sold Gambian rats. The asymptomatic or undetected circulation of OPXVs in humans in Cameroon is likely, and contact with monkeypox reservoirs is common, raising the need for continued surveillance for human and animal disease.", "autors": [{"firstname": "Anne", "middlename": "J", "surname": "Sarah"}, {"firstname": "", "middlename": "", "surname": "Guagliardo"}, {"firstname": "Benjamin", "middlename": "", "surname": "Monroe"}, {"firstname": "Christian", "middlename": "", "surname": "Moundjoa"}, {"firstname": "Ateba", "middlename": "", "surname": "Athanase"}, {"firstname": "Gordon", "middlename": "", "surname": "Okpu"}, {"firstname": "Jillybeth", "middlename": "", "surname": "Burgado"}, {"firstname": "Michael", "middlename": "B", "surname": "Townsend"}, {"firstname": "Panayampalli", "middlename": "S", "surname": "Satheshkumar"}, {"firstname": "Scott", "middlename": "", "surname": "Epperson"}, {"firstname": "Jeffrey", "middlename": "B", "surname": "Doty"}, {"firstname": "Mary", "middlename": "G", "surname": "Reynolds"}, {"firstname": "Elisabeth", "middlename": "", "surname": "Dibongue"}, {"firstname": "George", "middlename": "Alain", "surname": "Etoundi"}, {"firstname": "Els", "middlename": "", "surname": "Mathieu"}, {"firstname": "Andrea", "middlename": "M", "surname": "Mccollum2"}], "blocks": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["Monkeypox virus, which also includes Variola, Cowpox, and Vaccinia viruses.", "Orthopoxviruses provide immunological cross-protection such that infection with one OPXV or", "I ammunization with Vaccinia virus", "provides some degree of protection against the others in the genus.", "1,2", "Since the eradication of smallpox in 1980, there have been increasing OPXV outbreaks among both animals and humans, suggesting a shift in the ecology and evolution of OPXVs simultaneous with diminishing smallpox vaccine derived immunity.", "Monkeypox virus is endemic in West and Central Africa, and human infections are more frequently recognized.", "4", "In its most severe form, the clinical presentation of monkeypox is similar to that of smallpox, causing rashes following a prodromal period of fever, malaise, headache, and lymphadenopathy.", "7", "The gravity of monkeypox disease is determined by the exposure route, the strain and dose of the infecting virus, and the baseline health status of the patient.", "Of the two viral clades, the Congo Basin clade is thought to have more severe disease presentation than the West African clade.", "8,9 Monkeypox is on the rise in West and Central Africa, and in Cameroon, there have been a number of epidemiologic and epizootic events related to this emerging zoonosis.", "4", "Historical human cases have been noted in 1979 in Ekidmekoe village, in 1980 in the city of Moloundou, and in 1989 in * Address correspondence to Sarah Anne J.
