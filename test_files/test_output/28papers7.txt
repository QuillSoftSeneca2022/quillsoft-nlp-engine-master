		The seventh reported outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the equatorial African country of the Democratic Republic of Congo began on July twenty six two thousand and fourteen as another large EVD epidemic continued to spread in West Africa. Simultaneous reports of EVD in equatorial and West Africa raised the question of whether the two outbreaks were linked.

		We obtained data from patients in the DRC, using the standard World Health Organization clinical-investigation form for viral hemorrhagic fevers. Patients were classified as having suspected, probable, or confirmed EVD or a non-EVD illness. Blood samples were obtained for polymerase-chain-reaction based diagnosis, viral isolation, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis.

		The outbreak began in Inkanamongo village in the vicinity of Boende town in quateur province and has been confined to that province. A total of sixty nine suspected, probable, or confirmed cases were reported between July twenty six and October seven two thousand and fourteen including eight cases among health care workers, with forty nine deaths. As of October seven there have been approximately six generations of cases of EVD since the outbreak began. The reported weekly case incidence peaked in the weeks of August seventeen and twenty four and has since fallen sharply. Genome sequencing revealed Ebola virus as the because of this outbreak. A coding-complete genome sequence of EBOV that was isolated during this outbreak showed ninety nine point two percent  identity with the most closely related variant from the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety five outbreak in Kikwit in the DRC and ninety six point eight percent  identity to EBOV variants that are currently circulating in West Africa.

		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		The current EVD outbreak in the DRC has clinical and epidemiologic characteristics that are similar to those of previous EVD outbreaks in equatorial Africa. The causal agent is a local EBOV variant, and this outbreak has a zoonotic origin different from that in the two thousand and fourteen epidemic in West Africa. was notified of another EVD outbreak in the vicinity of Boende town, quateur province, in western Democratic Republic of Congo. Boende town lies seven hundred km northeast of the capital city, Kinshasa, and three hundred km east of Mbandaka, the capital of quateur province. The affected area is situated in humid tropical forest and delimited by two large rivers, which are the main channels for moving people and goods to and from Mbandaka. The roads in the area of Boende town are in poor condition, as are the bridges that cross a multitude of smaller rivers. There are few commercial flights in and out of Mbandaka and none out of Boende. This is the seventh Ebola outbreak in the DRC since the first was reported in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy six point one The index patient was a pregnant woman living in Inkanamongo village who butchered a monkey   variant, in comparison with variants isolated from West Africa. any person with a sudden onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms or clinical signs: headache, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, lethargy, stomach pain, aching muscles or joints, difficulty swallowing or breathing, or hiccup; unexplained bleeding; or any sudden, unexplained death. A probable case was defined as any suspected case evaluated by a clinician or any person who died from suspected EVD and had an epidemiologic link to a confirmed case but was not tested and did not have laboratory confirmation of the disease. A probable or suspected case was classified as confirmed when a sample from the affected person tested positive for EBOV in the laboratory. In this study, the final classification of patients remained as suspected or probable when a definitive diagnosis could not be made. We attempted to identify the source of infection in each patient with EVD by tracing contacts, mainly retrospectively. Blood Samples The first samples were collected from eight symptomatic patients with suspected EVD who visited the Lokolia health center in quateur province. As in previous EVD outbreaks, blood samples were collected, with oral consent, either at the homes of patients or in hospital isolation wards, by a team that included staff members of the Ministry of Health in the DRC and the WHO. Samples were placed in dry tubes and immediately transported to Institut National de Recherche Biom dicale, Kinshasa, DRC, for laboratory testing and storage. Blood samples were also sent to the WHO reference center for the diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic fever, the Centre International de Recherches M dicales de Franceville, Gabon, for confirmation. At all stages, essential biosecurity measures were taken to avoid contamination of personnel and the environment.

The amplification cycle involved two minutes at fifty five C and an initial denaturation at ninety five C for ten minutes, followed by forty five cycles at ninety five C for fifteen seconds and at fifty eight C for one minute. For samples with positive results on RT-PCR, a PCR assay targeting a fragment of the filovirus polymerase gene was performed with the use of the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR Kit, using the ClustalW algorithm and MEGA five software package. We used the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method in MrBayes, version three point two software to infer the phylogenetic trees, using two runs of four chains with one million generations, with a burn-in rate of twenty five percent  and the GTR+G+I nucleotide substitution model.

		Tissue cultures were performed in a biosafety level four laboratory. Monolayers of Vero cells in sixwell plates were incubated for one hour at thirty seven C with fifty l of serum from each sample at one:one0 dilution in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium. Medium containing two.five percent  fetal-calf serum and antibiotic mix was added, and cells were incubated at thirty seven C in five percent  carbon dioxide for seven days. Supernatant was harvested and stored at eighty C until it was used for genomic characterization. Viral growth in the cell lines was confirmed with the use of a specific real-time RT-PCR assay, as described above. Clinical and Epidemiologic Analysis From July twenty six to October seven, two thousand and fourteen we identified sixty nine patients with EVD that was suspected, probable. Of these patients, thirty three were male and thirty six were female; eighty percent  of the patients were adults between the ages of twenty one and sixty years. Among the patients with suspected disease, a higher proportion of children than adults were found to have non-EVD illnesses. Of the sixty nine patients, twenty one male patients and twenty eight female patients died, including three children under the age of five years, resulting in a case fatality rate of seventy four percent  among probable and confirmed cases, if all cases and deaths were reported. For twenty eight paired contacts of patients with EVD, the median interval between dates of the reported onset of symptoms was sixteen days was sixteen point one four point four days, similar to that in West Africa. For thirty two of the forty nine patients who died, the median time from reported symptom onset to death was eleven days, and the mean was eleven point three 6.eight; the interval was not measured for the other patients who died. All eight health workers who were affected four with probable EVD and four with confirmed EVD died. As compared with patients with suspected EVD who were found to have non-EVD illnesses, patients with probable or confirmed EVD were more likely to have fever, headache, diarrhea, vomiting or nausea, fatigue, anorexia, muscle pain, difficulty swallowing, conjunctivitis, and blood in stools or vomit. This outbreak has been driven by human-tohuman transmission, but all cases and contacts appear to have originated from a single index case in other words, there was no evidence of more than one transfer of infection from an animal reservoir. So far, all cases have been confined to quateur province, including Boende town   with the most closely related variant that was isolated during the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety five Kikwit outbreak. Among the one hundred and forty five mutations, twenty two were nonsynonymous, but none were expected to induce any important change in viral protein sequences. In particular, we observed five nonsynonymous mutations in the NP gene, one in the VPthreefive gene, one in the VPfour0 gene, eight in the GP gene, none in the VPthree0 gene, two in the VPtwofour gene, and five in the L gene. The ne w engl and jour nal of medicine ing on two additional positive samples after random amplification of extracted total RNA from serum samples. Given the moderate viral load in the serum, we could not obtain the complete sequences but only two thousand, two hundred and seventy bp from one sample and twelve thousand, five hundred and one bp from the other sample. Analysis of these partial sequences showed an identity of one hundred percent  with the complete sequence obtained previously, further suggesting that the current outbreak in the DRC is due to a single introduction of this novel EBOV variant into the human population. In contrast to the similarity between the Boende variant and other equatorial African variants, the gene sequence of the Lokolia isolate showed only ninety six point eight percent  identity with the West African variants, with six hundred and one mutations as compared with a Guinean variant and six hundred and two mutations as compared with a Sierra Leonean variant.

	Title: Discussion
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		EVD first emerged in human populations in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy six causing nearly simultaneous, but unrelated, outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan, inadequate availability of disinfectants and protective equipment, and lack of knowledge of microbiologic hygiene by health care workers, along with local resistance to public health measures proposed by national authorities. The second possible reason why EVD outbreaks have been smaller in equatorial Africa is that infection and illness caused by EBOV variants that are characteristic of equatorial Africa, including the variant that emerged in the Boende district, take a different clinical course from those in West Africa, with different epidemiologic consequences. We have found that equatorial and West African variants of EBOV are genetically distinct, as did Baize et al. In addition, the genetic diversity among equatorial African isolates appears to be low, as compared with the extensive variation, including many nonsynonymous mutations, that has been identified among West African EBOV isolates, even though the equatorial African variants have been collected over a period of nearly four decades. Against this background, there is currently no evidence that variants from the two regions are associated with such factors as differences in the infectious period, case fatality rate, or frequency of hemorrhagic disease. The third possible explanation for the smaller outbreaks in equatorial Africa, such as the one in the Boende area, is that they have largely occurred in remote forested areas, where the number of human contacts is limited in small populations living at low density, with infrequent or slow connections by road, river, or air. This is in contrast to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, where villages, towns, and capital cities are connected by an extensive network of footpaths, dirt roads, and paved highways.

		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo road network is international: in the areas where Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have common borders, single ethnic groups inhabit more than one country, and cross-border travel is frequent, for purposes of commerce and to maintain family ties. Unlike the outbreak in the Boende area, the West African epidemic has been multinational almost from the start, with the transportation of both patients with EVD and bodies of deceased patients across borders, complicating the organization of public health measures. The fourth possible explanation for the smaller outbreaks in equatorial Africa is that the response to Ebola outbreaks has been faster and more effective in the DRC and neighboring countries. With the experience of six previous EVD epidemics, the DRC is now well prepared. The time that it takes to respond to news of an outbreak has been shortened over the years. There is also substantial national expertise in managing EVD outbreaks, including skills in epidemiology, laboratory analysis, and patient care, with readily available international support. During the present outbreak, action was quickly taken to inform the affected communities and to assign responsibilities for control measures to village chiefs, religious and social leaders, traditional healers, and medical staff members. These actions were coupled with the introduction of basic infection-control measures for example, on the basis of the slogan no family without detergent, hand sanitizers were distributed to all affected communities to help stop transmission. Finally, EVD may have spread more widely in West Africa because the human population is less resistant to infection than in equatorial Africa, either because there has been no previous exposure to EBOV or for some other reason. This possibility has not yet been investigated because, for example, we currently have little information about the risk that EVD will develop in a person after exposure to EBOV. Although none of these possibilities can be ruled out, the third and fourth possibilities appear to be the most plausible on the basis of the current evidence. The coming days and weeks will reveal whether the new EBOV variant that was isolated in the Boende area is on the point of being eliminated from the human population, as in previous EVD outbreaks in the DRC. Regardless of the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of this outbreak that are associated with the virus or the animal and human host populations, a continuing, comprehensive public health response will be critical for success.
