ABSTRACT
 

 

Background 
A swine flu pandemic hit the world and India was no 
exception. Many deaths were reported in metropolitan 
cities. Knowledge about the infection is an important 
element of control of the infection. 
Method 
This cross sectional survey was conducted at a tertiary care 
centre hospital where the patients are referred from 
different parts of Haryana accompanied by relatives 
therefore it was regarded as a potentially high-risk area for 
the spread of Influenza A   and chosen to assess the 
knowledge, attitude and practice in relation to swine flu. A 
self administered questionnaire involved 42 hospital staff 
members   accompanying 
the patients from 1st September 2009 to 15th October 2009. 
Results 
Out of all respondents only 25% had heard of swine flu 
before and out of which 65% HS & 37% GP knew more than 
three correct symptoms. There were 86% respondents 

  who thought that touching the eyes, 
nose or mouth without washing hands can spread the 
disease. Altogether 80% respondents thought that the 
disease was controllable while, nearly 92% of respondents 
knew about the nearest swine flu control or testing centre. 
Among all hardly 10% had attended some type of  
awareness program for swine flu control and 62% were 
taking precautions against the spread of swine flu. Nearly 
70% of respondents thought that masks prevent the disease 
while about 98% washed their hands before having meal. 
Nearly 72% of this knowledge was from television and 20% 
from newspapers. 
Conclusion 
In the present study group many of the respondents didn t 
know about swine flu. Most were from the general 
population. We recommend a public health campaign in 
Haryana.

Background 
Swine   Flu  pandemic  detected  in  April  2009   contained   
a combination of genes from swine, avian, and human 
influenza viruses.1,2 The outbreak began in Mexico, with 
evidence that there had been an ongoing epidemic for 
months before it was officially recognized as such. The 
virus continued to spread globally, and the World Health 
Organization   in June declared the outbreak to be a 
pandemic4 and raised a strong signal that a pandemic is 
imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, 
communication and implementation of the planned 
mitigation measures is short. As of 6 August 2009, the 
World Health Organization reported 1,77,457 laboratory 
confirmed cases of influenza A/H1N1 and 1,462 deaths. 
India was no exception and many deaths (138 as of 9 
September 2009) were reported in metropolitan cities such 
as Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore. Given the seriousness of 
the situation and lack of any specific vaccine against 
Influenza A, mitigation measures in the India have so

far focused on identifying, treating, and isolating people 
who have the disease and educating the public about the 
steps that individuals can take to reduce the risk of 
transmission. These recommendations include using tissues 
when sneezing, washing hands regularly with soap and 
water. The media, including both televised and written 
media, and to a lesser extent the radio and the internet, 
where free uncensored writing and YOU-tube postings take 
place had led to inappropriate behaviour by the public such 
as; refusal to comply with precautionary measures, 
including wearing a mask or accepting a vaccination; 
avoidance of certain activities including visiting the hospital 
due to fear of healthcare facilities as a venue for acquiring 
the infection.8-10 There was a large need for the 
dissemination of accurate information to overcome the 
misinformed dialogue taking place on TV, newspapers and 
internet. 11 During a pandemic, public health agencies can 
play critical roles in controlling the spread of disease. 
Therefore the present study was designed to assess the 
knowledge, attitude and practice during swine flu epidemic 
among the medical staff and the general population. 

 

Method 
This cross sectional survey was conducted at a tertiary care 
centre hospital where the patients are referred from 
different parts of Haryana accompanied by relatives 
therefore it was regarded as a potentially high-risk area for 
the spread of Influenza A   and chosen to assess the 
knowledge, attitude and practice in relation to swine flu. A 
self administered questionnaire involved 42 hospital staff 
members   accompanying 
the patients from 1st September 2009 to 15th October 2009. 

 

Results 
A total of 400 subjects (Hospital staff= 42 & general 
population= 358) with mean   SD age group of 31.42   
10.65 years   participated in the study. 
There were 214 males and 186 females. 

 

Knowledge response 
Out of all respondents only 25%   had heard of swine 
flu before. Out of these 25%   
hospital staff   
knew about symptoms of swine flu. Sixty five percent of HS 
and thirty seven percent of GP knew more than three 
correct symptoms. 65% of HS and 74% of GP thought that 
this was a disease of children and elderly patients, while 
35% of HS and 22% of GP thought that adults with co 
morbidities like asthma and diabetes were at a greater risk 
and only 2% of GP didn t know about it. There were 95% HS 
and 86% general people who thought that touching of eyes, 
nose or mouth without washing hands can spread the 
disease while only 5% HS and 10% GP thought that it was 
partially true and 6.66 % of GP didn t know the answer. 
Altogether, 80% of HS and GP thought that the disease was 
controllable while, 15% of HS and 10% of GP thought that it 
was not and 10% of GP didn t know the answer. Nearly 95% 
of HS and 92% of GP knew about the nearest swine flu 
control or testing centre and half of HS were aware of the 

second wave of swine flu epidemic but 72% of GP were not 
aware of it. 

 

Attitude response 
Only 10% of HS and GP had attended some type of 
awareness program for swine flu control. Nearly 65% 
  did not avoid public gatherings like 
parties and group meetings of the fear of swine flu while 
rest 35% avoid such meetings. Nearly 70% of respondents 
  definitely thought that mask 
prevents the disease and 20%   
thought that it was partially true and only 10% (HS=5% & 
GP=13.33%) didn t know the answer. 

 

Practice response 
About 98% respondents   wash 
their hands before having meals. 62% (HS=55% & 
GP=66.67%) were definitely taking precautions against the 
spread of swine flu while 14%   were 
taking 
partial 
precautions, 
while 
24% 
(HS=25% 
& 

GP=23.33%) were not taking any precautions. Disposal of 
mask was done by throwing them into the dustbin by 34% 
  while, disposal by burning  was 
done by 20%. However, 46% 
  did not know how to dispose masks. Of 
the respondents 46%   thought that 
it was not safe to reuse the mask more than once and 3.33% 
general population thought that this was partially true while 
40% respondents   did not knew the 
answer and 12%   answered that 
mask can be reused. There were 94%   
of respondents who thought that if they had developed the 
symptoms of swine flu then they would have contacted the 
swine flu centre immediately for diagnosis while only 10% 
hospital staff thought that they would have taken the 
proper precautions to prevent the spread of disease and 5% 
of HS thought that they would have done both. Nearly 94% 
respondents   used tissue or 
handkerchief while sneezing or coughing and when the 
respondents had to visit some swine flu infected area then 
40%   wash their hands with soap 
and water more frequently and thoroughly while 40% 
  respondents avoid contact with the 
people who appeared sick and 30%   
followed the both precautions. 

Discussion 
In spite of the increase in the number of Influenza A   
cases as well as the response of the WHO by raising its 
pandemic alert status to phase 6 and extensive media 
coverage, public responses to Influenza A   were 
muted. In practice, convincing the public that the threat is 
real is often a more pressing task for public health agencies 
than providing reassurance. 7 Many reports have examined 
the various levels of knowledge about infectious agents and 
public behavior in relation to these infections; such studies 
have primarily focused on the SARS and avian influenza 
outbreaks.8, 13 Other studies have been recently published 
specifically on behavioral and attitudinal responses to 
pandemic   2009 Influenza.10, 14-16

In our study nearly 75% of the respondents had never heard 
of the swine flu before out of which 99.33% were of general 
population and only 0.67% were of medical staff. Out of 
which 52% knew more than three symptoms. In another 
study by Kamate et al 83% of subjects had heard about 
swine flu. In another study 44% of national sample of adult 
Australians reported having knowledge of the term 
pandemic influenza,18 a finding similar to that of a study 
conducted in the USA in 2006 in which 41% of respondents 
had previously heard of this term. So here we conclude 
that our respondents have far less knowledge about swine 
flu than the above studies and the reason may be lack of 
public health communications. 

 

In our study nearly 72 % of respondents learned about 
swine flu from television while about 20% came to know 
about the disease in newspapers and only 8% through word 
of mouth. Similarly in an another study the majority   
of the participants received their information about swine 
flu from the television; 51.1% received information from 
written media such as newspapers and magazines, while 
48.2% received information from the internet. 

 

In a recent review of behavioural responses to influenza 
pandemics in the 20th century,20 the only two measures 
that had strong support by scientific literature to lessen the 
spread of the diseases were hand hygiene and respiratory 
etiquette. School closure and screening of travellers had 

reduced the use of public transportation; 74.3% had not 
taken any time off work; However, more than half the 
respondents   avoided crowded places and 
54.6% washed their hands with soap and water more often 
than usual, and 63.6% were not overtly worried about 
cleaning or disinfecting things that they might touch. 

 

Nearly 70% of the respondents believed that using masks 
definitely prevents swine flu while 20% were not sure 
whether masks could prevent from the disease and 10% 
didn t knew the answer. Nearly 34% disposed the used  
mask by throwing it into dustbin, 20% disposed them by 
burning and 46% did not know how to dispose the masks. In 
another study the willingness to wear a mask during a 
pandemic was surprisingly high, particularly as this is 
not common practice in Australia. Use of masks by the 
general public in China, Hong Kong, Special Administrative 
Region, during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome 
  outbreak was below this level. 

 

Eighty percent of our respondents definitely thought that 
the disease was controllable while 10% thought that this 
was partially true while in an another study two percent of 
the respondents were of the opinion that Influenza A 
  would not affect their health; 36.4% feared  that 
they would be somewhat affected; 34.5% believed that they 
would be seriously affected; and 27.1% had no idea about 
the effect of Influenza A   on their health. 

legal and ethical  consequences when  implemented.  While 
  
 

the other four measures, including isolation and wearing of 
a surgical mask or an N95 mask, had cost effectiveness 
concerns and would be difficult to implement over long 
periods of time.21, 22 Maximum of the respondents   
thought that swine flu can be spread by poor hygiene like 
touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands 
and actually 98% of respondents washed their hands before 
meals while nearly 94% use tissue or handkerchief while 
coughing or sneezing. In another study nearly, one-third 
reported avoiding touching their eyes, nose, or mouth 
  and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue 
when coughing or sneezing. However, only onefourth 
of participants reported throwing the tissue in the 
trash after use   and avoiding normal activities if they 
have flulike symptoms  .17 

 

It is important to know what proportion of the population is 
concerned about contracting a disease since those who are 
concerned would be expected to take more precautions. In 
a telephone-assisted survey of 2,081 adults above the age  
of 16 years, the New South Wales Department of Health 
found that only 48.3% of those interviewed were willing to 
comply with precautionary measures.23,24 In our study 
nearly 66% responded that they did not avoid public 
gatherings like parties or group meetings but 40% of the 
respondents washed their hand with soap and water 
thoroughly and more frequently when they visit swine flu 
infected areas while, 40% avoided close contact with the 
people who appeared unwell. In another study 59.5% had 
not cancelled or postponed any social event; 67.6% had not
