Title: Ecology of Ebolavirus: A Review of Current Knowledge, Speculations and Future Research Directions
/***********************************************************************/
Abstract: Ebola virus disease, which emerged in West Africa in March two thousand and fourteen infected about twenty eight thousand, six hundred and sixteen people resulting in the death of over eleven thousand people. After the discovery of the Ebola virus in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy six over twenty outbreaks have been reported. The two thousand and fourteen/two thousand and fifteen outbreak, started in Guinea in March two thousand and fourteen spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, with few cases in other countries including Nigeria, Senegal and Mali, and isolated cases in Europe and US. Though there have been no approved/licensed drugs or preventive vaccines, some therapies and vaccines, which have entered phase three clinical trials, have shown promising results. This virus emerges and re-emerges sporadically. Hence, the aim of this review is to assess the ecology of the virus with the view of understanding the ecological basis for the emergence and re-emergence of the virus. Bats are thought to be the primary/reservoir hosts of the ebolavirus, great apes the possible intermediate hosts, and humans the end hosts. But it also appears that decomposers and scavengers such as insects, rodents and other animals could possibly play a role in the spread and sustenance of ebolavirus in the forest ecosystem. Climate change and human activities such as urbanization, deforestation, agricultural intensification, hunting and consumption of wildlife, which disturb forest ecosystems, may have contributed to the sporadic emergence of the virus.

		TFiloviruses particularly Ebola and Marburg viruses causes deadly hemorrhagic fevers in humans and non-human primates particularly the great apes. Ebola virus disease, which is also known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever is caused by Ebola virus, which has a case fatality rate of up to ninety percent. Ebola virus is among the most dangerous microorganisms today. It has been classified as Category A biothreat pathogen. Ebola and Marburg virus have been linked to several sporadic outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever especially in East and Central Africa. Ebolavirus has been described as pathogen causing emerging and re-emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks in humans. There are indicators that the frequency, scale and severity of outbreaks are increasing. For nearly forty years, the science community has been researching on Ebola virus. Recent findings suggest that outbreaks of Ebola virus might not just be sporadic as previously thought, but could be linked to changes in ecology that brought humans in close proximity to natural / primary host and immediate hosts of Ebola virus due to human exploitation of previously unoccupied forest ecosystems. Ebola virus was first discovered in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy six with twin simultaneous outbreaks in Nzara, south Sudan and Yambuku, Zaire now Democratic Republic of Congo, while Marburg virus was discovered in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty seven in Germany and Yogoslavia, where the virus was first isolated from African green Monkeys imported from Uganda. The two thousand and fourteen/two thousand and fifteen Ebola virus disease outbreak started in Guinea in the Gueckedon region from where it spread to neighboring countries i.e. Sierra Leone and Liberia. The suspected index case was a two year old boy who possibly became infected on six December, two thousand and thirteen and on twenty two March two thousand and fourteen, the World Health Organization officially declared Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Soon the disease spread to other countries including Liberia, with minor cases in Nigeria all in West Africa and few imported cases to other countries including US and Mali. While ebolavirus was rapidly curtailed in other countries it persisted for longer periods in the three West African countries where the epidemic started. At the end of December two thousand and fourteen, over twenty zero EVD cases have been reported with nearly fifty percent  fatality. A total twenty seven thousand, nine hundred and eighty eight persons have been infected worldwide with the following breakdown in the three main countries; Guinea, agricultural practices and socioeconomics conditions that linked bats to the intermediate hosts. Other drivers include urbanization, ecotourism, cultural practices, trade and international travel. Plowright, and others described a series of connected enabling conditions necessary for spillover of emerging bat viruses to include; infection and distribution of reservoir host, pathogen shedding/survival outside the host, and spillover to susceptible host. Pigott, and others used vegetation, elevation, temperature, evapotranspiration and bat distribution to map the zoonotic niche of EVD in Africa and found twenty two million people at risk in twenty two countries across Central and West Africa including Nigeria, Cameroun, CAR, Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola, Tanzania, Togo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar and Malawi. Future Research Directions From the literature, it appears that Ebola virus that was restricted to the Congolean forest in Central Africa has spread to other regions on the continent in West and Southern Africa due possibly to the activities of migratory bats. About twenty two million people in twenty two countries across Africa are now potentially at risk of infection by Ebola. The bats could transmit the virus to other wildlife unnoticed, from where the virus could amplify and because outbreaks in wildlife and spill over to humans sporadically. Research into ecological and other important aspects of viral transmission should therefore focus on the following research areas.

		There is need to understand the route and seasonality of viral shedding in bats. X. The possibility of boosting bat immune system to suppress the replication of ebolavirus could be explored.

		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Ebolavirus emerged for the first time in West Africa causing large fatalities in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone with minor cases in Nigeria, Senegal and Mali and few imported cases into US and Spain. Because of the devastating effect of the two thousand and fourteen/two thousand and fifteen West Africa EVD, attracted several research attentions, but thus far no approved vaccine or therapeutics for the disease. The epidemic has ended. But outbreaks could occur in the future because the virus is still circulating in African tropical forests, hence the need for vigilance. It may be difficult to stop the virus in the wild, but the transmission to intermediate host could be mitigated by the use of replicating vaccines. Human drivers of forest degradation could be reduced and bush meat consumption could be stopped. Acknowledgement The author wishes to thank Sylvester C.
