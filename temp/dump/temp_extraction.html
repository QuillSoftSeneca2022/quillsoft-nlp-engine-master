Since then many newer incidences was <br>recognized in India, but there was no sufficient data from all state of India. This <br>study will provide data from the Chhattisgarh state of India. <br>Methods: It was a retrospective observational study from December 2015 to <br>November 2017. All patient samples with suspected influenza infection were <br>collected and analysed by Real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR<br>). <br>Results: 341 patients' sample was collected and analysed; among these samples, <br>07.9% of patients have all three serotype of influenza positive. Raipur district has <br>the highest incidence of influenza A followed by Durg and Raigarh district of <br>Chhattisgarh. There was no significant difference between male and female who <br>was affected by the influenza virus. <br>Conclusions: The incidence of Human influenza virus is lesser in Chhattisgarh <br>as compare to the average states of India and the state capital has a higher rate of <br>sample collection as well as positive influenza infection. <br><br> <br><br>Keywords: Chhattisgarh, Influenza, Incidence, Oseltamivir, Pandemic <br><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br>INTRODUCTION<br> <br><br>Human influenza virus is a pig transmitted infectious <br>disease and it is appeared to be highest mortality causing <br>disease since past decade. In 2009, it was recognized as <br>pandemic infectious disease by World health Organization, which was transmitted via human to human by <br>aerosol. Influenza was first time recognized as Spanish flu <br>in 1918-1919, which was also pandemic in nature. Illness <br>oftenly present in farmers who had swine in their farms <br>and that was observed by veterinarian J. S. Koen. The <br>isolation of pig derived H1N1 virus was first time obtained <br>during 1930 by Shope and Lewis then in 1974 human <br><br>derived H1N1 virus was isolated, which confirm the <br>hypothesis that pig derived H1N1 virus could infect human <br>too. <br><br> <br><br>Human influenza or H1N1 influenza or Swine flu is a <br>respiratory tract disorder comprised of flu like symptoms <br>which include sore throat, rhinorrhoea, fever, chills, <br>vomiting, restlessness, anorexia, headache, arthralgia and <br>diarrhea. In patients with immune deficit, the clinical <br>presentation of swine flu could be worsen and may lead to <br>altered sensorium and respiratory collapse. Till date five <br>serotype of H1N1 influenza was isolated which are H1N1, <br>H1N2, H2N3, H3N1, and H3N2. Among these only H1N1 <br>causes human infection and rest are seen only in pigs. <br><br> <br> <br><br>Sharma R and others Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Jun;8 :1288-1291 <br> <br><br> <br> <br><br>Swine flu is an orthomyxo RNA virus, having two surface <br>antigens   and N1 (Neuraminidase <br>type 1).1 <br><br> <br><br>In India, 27,236 laboratory confirmed cases with 981 <br>deaths were reported during 2009.4,5 The post pandemic <br>period   62,000 laboratory confirmed swine flu <br>with 5000 deaths was reported by the Ministry of Health <br>and Family Welfare and also stated that the incidence was <br>high during monsoon   and low during <br>winter  .4-8 The incidences of H1N1 <br>influenza were keep rising worldwide. In India there was <br>lack in sufficient data of human influenza virus infection <br>from the many states. This study will provide the newly <br>laboratory diagnosed cases of human influenza virus <br>infection in the state of Chhattisgarh. <br><br> <br><br>METHODS <br><br> <br><br>It was hospital-based retrospective descriptive, recordbased <br>analysis from December 2015 to November 2017. <br>This study was carried out in the Department of <br>Pharmacology, <br>Late <br>BRKM <br>Government <br>Medical <br><br>College, Dimrapal, Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh. Patients with <br>the sign and symptoms of influenza viral infection who are <br>falling under category B and C and Confirm case (tested <br>positive for influenza infection) by real-time reverse <br>transcription polymerase chain reaction   were <br>included in this study. <br><br> <br><br>Patients from category B and C were administered proper <br>therapy for influenza viral infection and samples were sent <br>for confirmation, if the sample was negative, treatment <br>was <br>discontinued. <br>The <br>data <br>related <br>to <br>patients' <br><br>demographics from the H1N1 visiting screening centers, <br>swine flu outpatient departments and swine flu isolation <br>wards and hospitals from Chhattisgarh were collected. <br>Testing of influenza virus was carried out at microbiology <br>department of Late BRKM Government Medical College, <br>Dimrapal, Jagdalpur. <br><br> <br><br>Collection of samples and confirmation <br><br> <br><br>Throat or nasal swab samples of suspected cases with <br>influenza-like sign and symptoms were collected in Viral <br>Transport Medium and sent to laboratories maintaining <br>cold-chain. RNA was extracted by Purelink Viral <br>RNA/DNA blood Mini Kit. RNA of <br>each isolate was tested by separate primer/probe sets for <br>InfA, H1N1 and H1 subtype as per the CDC real-time RTPCR <br>protocol (ABI Step One Plus RT-PCR instrumentApplied <br>Biosystems, USA).10 All the data related to <br>demographic characteristics, was analysed using Epi Info <br>v7.2 and Yates corrected chi-square   test. P-value <br><0.05 was considered statistically significant. <br><br> <br><br>RESULTS <br><br> <br><br>Total 341 samples were collected from different hospitals <br>and medical colleges in the state with suspected H1N1 <br><br>infection. Out of total 341 sample, 54% patients were male <br>and the mean age was 30.39 19.2, years-wise <br>comparison depicted in Table 1. Trends of suspected cases <br>of influenza infection between both the gender, higher <br>percentage among female 31 to 40 were observed between <br>21 to 30 year of age and in males at 0-10 years were the <br>highest. Between Dec 2015 to Nov 2017, only <br>7.9% patients were found to be positive of all three <br>subtypes of human influenza stain like H1N1, Influenza-A <br>and H1-subtype, while 46.3%   patients was found <br>positive for influenza-A, 17.3%   for H1N1, 24.9% <br>  for H1 subtype infection by RT PCR and all three <br>was positive in 7.9%. Populated region of <br>Chhattisgarh has higher rate of suspected cases such as <br>Raipur, and Durg, even the most <br>Trible region of Chhattisgarh   has comparable <br>higher rate than other district. Maximum number of <br>sample was send from the Raipur district followed by Durg <br>and Raigarh. <br><br> <br><br>Table 1: Age wise distribution of Human Influenza <br><br>patients. <br><br> <br><br>Age in decades   <br>Male <br>Female <br>P Value <br><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br> : Incidence of newer diagnosed human <br><br>influenza subtypes from December 2015November 2017. <br><br> <br><br>The 41.8%   sample was positive for Influenza A, <br>39%   for H1 subtype <br>infection in district Raipur, whereas in district Durg and <br>Raigarh has 8.9%, 11.9%, 10.6% and 2.5%, 13.6%, 11.8% <br>sample was positive for Influenza A, H1N1 and H1 <br>subtype, respectively. <br><br> <br> <br><br><image: DeviceRGB, width 482, height 372, bpc 8><br>H1 subtupe <br>H1 N1 <br>Influenza A <br><br>Incidence of Human Influenza <br><br>Sharma R and others Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Jun;8 :1288-1291 <br> <br><br>H1 subtupe <br><br> <br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> : Distribution of percentage of sample sends <br><br>by the district of Chhattisgarh. <br><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br> : Distribution of Sero-positive influenza <br><br>subtype in most occurring districts of Chhattisgarh. <br><br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br><br> : Comparison of positive influenza serotype in <br><br>between gender. <br><br> <br><br>Raipur has significant number of positive cases of <br>influenza A, H1N1 and H1 subtype than other district of <br>Chhattisgarh state. There was slightly higher <br>incidence of Influenza A, H1N1, and H1 subtype observed <br>in male patients than female. The mean percentage of <br>Influenza- The positive test for influenza A, H1N1, and H1 <br><br>subtype was high in males than female patients. A was <br>positive in male patient was 51.3% as compare to female <br>patient was 48.7%, while 52.5% male patients <br>were positive for H1N1 as compare to 47.5% female <br>patients and H1 subtype was positive in 50.6% male <br>patient vs. 49.4% in female patients. <br><br> <br><br>DISCUSSION <br><br> <br><br>The incidence of human influenza viral infection in <br>Chhattisgarh is comparable from other state of India. The <br>collections of sample were higher during rainy season as <br>reported in national health profile of India. From <br>December 2015 to November 2017, a total number of 341 <br>samples were sent to our center, out of which, highest <br>number of sample   was received from Raipur district <br>followed by Durg   district, which was comparable with the incidence of <br>human influenza infection in the district of Rajasthan. <br><br>Among these samples 07.9% was seropositive for all three <br>subtypes of influenza virus such as Influenza-A, H1N1, <br>and H1 Subtype. <br><br> <br><br>The incidence of Influenza-A was 46.3%, H1N1, <br>and H1 subtype was 24.9%   from Dec-2015-2017. Among higher reporting districts of <br>Chhattisgarh, the overall newer case of from Raipur was <br>41.8%   and Baster <br>  for Influenza-A subtype. Similarly, H1N1 is also <br>most common seen in Raipur   followed by Raigarh <br>  and, H1 Subtype incidences <br>were also high in Raipur   <br>followed by Durg. These results <br>signify the higher rate of incidence commonly seen in the <br>state capital as also observed by Malhotra et al. The mean <br>age of male patients those samples was obtained was <br>30.39 19.2 years as compare to female patients was <br>30.77 18.8. In female, common age group <br>presenting Influenza like symptoms was 21-30 years, while the common age group in male patients was <br>31-40 years, age-wise distribution is shown in the <br>table-1, and similar distribution was also observed by <br>choudhary et al. <br><br> <br><br>The management of Human Influenza virus is requires <br>isolation of infected person with antiviral therapy and <br>curative management of other complications. Antiviral <br>therapy <br>mainly <br>includes <br>Oseltamivir, <br>Zanamivir, <br><br>Peramivir, <br>Laninamivir <br>which <br>are <br>neuraminidase <br><br>inhibitors   and Adamantanes such as Amantadine <br>and Rimantadine.13,14 Nowadays only NAIs is effective <br>against swine flu due development of resistance against <br>adamantanes.13,14 In India, Oseltamivir and Zanamivir is <br>used for the treatment as well as for the prophylaxis of <br>human influenza. According to WHO, Uncomplicated <br>cases does not require antiviral therapy, only patients with <br>suspected symptoms in high risk group were advocated for <br>antiviral therapy. All patients including pregnant females <br>were included by WHO for antiviral therapy. <br><br> <br> <br><br>Durg <br>9% <br>Mahasamund <br>5% <br><br>Raipur <br><br>37% <br>Rajnandgaon <br>3% <br><br>Dhamtari <br><br>Bilashpur <br><br>Gariyaban <br><br>Baster <br><br>7% <br>Raigarh <br><br>BalodaBazar <br><br><br>Rest of the <br><br>Bemetara <br><br><image: DeviceRGB, width 388, height 244, bpc 8><br><image: DeviceRGB, width 275, height 93, bpc 8><br>H1 subtype <br><br>Influenza A <br>80 <br><br><image: DeviceRGB, width 429, height 339, bpc 8><br>H1 Subtype <br>Influenza A <br>H1 N1 <br><br>Number of Sample tested <br><br>Positive <br><br>Percentage of incidence <br><br>Sharma R and others Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Jun;8 :1288-1291 <br> <br><br> <br> <br><br>In adults, oseltamivir is prescribed 75 mg twice daily <br>regimen for 5 days, while Zanamivir is given in a dose of <br>10 mg twice daily, both drugs can be used as prophylaxis <br>of swine flu in an once daily regimen. Chemoprophylaxis <br>should be given to the healthcare professionals, <br>Oseltamivir is given once daily for 10 days and may be <br>extended upto 6 weeks depending upon duration of close <br>contact to the patients. WHO also recommended the <br>vaccine for the healthcare professionals, the response of <br>the vaccine will come after 2-3 weeks after vaccination. <br>There were some limitation in our study; the power of <br>study was low due to less sample size; the mortality was <br>not calculated and we unable to find the commonest sign <br>and symptoms of human influenza virus in Chhattisgarh <br>region of India. <br><br> <br><br>CONCLUSION <br><br> <br><br>The case of Human influenza virus in Chhattisgarh from <br>the period of December 2015 to November 2017 was only <br>341 which was less than many states of Chhattisgarh. <br>Higher incidences were observed in the state capital then <br>neighbouring district like Durg and Raigarh. There was no <br>significant difference in between gender affected by <br>human influenza, while Influenza A was more common <br>than H1N1 and H1 subtype among the all received <br>samples. The treatment remains the same for swine flu, <br>which includes neuraminidase inhibitors   and <br>Adamantanes. <br><br> <br><br>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS <br><br> <br><br>Authors would like to thank Department of Microbiology, <br>Late BRKM GMC Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh. <br><br> <br><br>Funding: No funding sources <br>Conflict of interest: None declared <br>Ethical approval: The study was approved by the <br>Institutional Ethics Committee <br><br> <br><br>REFERENCES <br><br> <br><br>1.
