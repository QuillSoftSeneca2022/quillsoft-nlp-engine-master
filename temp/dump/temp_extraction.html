Many deaths were reported in metropolitan <br>cities. Knowledge about the infection is an important <br>element of control of the infection. <br>Method <br>This cross sectional survey was conducted at a tertiary care <br>centre hospital where the patients are referred from <br>different parts of Haryana accompanied by relatives <br>therefore it was regarded as a potentially high-risk area for <br>the spread of Influenza A   and chosen to assess the <br>knowledge, attitude and practice in relation to swine flu. A <br>self administered questionnaire involved 42 hospital staff <br>members   accompanying <br>the patients from 1st September 2009 to 15th October 2009. <br>Results <br>Out of all respondents only 25% had heard of swine flu <br>before and out of which 65% HS & 37% GP knew more than <br>three correct symptoms. There were 86% respondents <br><br>  who thought that touching the eyes, <br>nose or mouth without washing hands can spread the <br>disease. Altogether 80% respondents thought that the <br>disease was controllable while, nearly 92% of respondents <br>knew about the nearest swine flu control or testing centre. <br>Among all hardly 10% had attended some type of  <br>awareness program for swine flu control and 62% were <br>taking precautions against the spread of swine flu. Nearly <br>70% of respondents thought that masks prevent the disease <br>while about 98% washed their hands before having meal. <br>Nearly 72% of this knowledge was from television and 20% <br>from newspapers. <br>Conclusion <br>In the present study group many of the respondents didn t <br>know about swine flu. Most were from the general <br>population. We recommend a public health campaign in <br>Haryana. <br><br> <br><br>Key Words <br>Swine flu, knowledge, attitude, practices, medical staff <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>Background <br>Swine   Flu  pandemic  detected  in  April  2009   contained   <br>a combination of genes from swine, avian, and human <br>influenza viruses.1,2 The outbreak began in Mexico, with <br>evidence that there had been an ongoing epidemic for <br>months before it was officially recognized as such. The <br>virus continued to spread globally, and the World Health <br>Organization   in June declared the outbreak to be a <br>pandemic4 and raised a strong signal that a pandemic is <br>imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, <br>communication and implementation of the planned <br>mitigation measures is short. As of 6 August 2009, the <br>World Health Organization reported 1,77,457 laboratory <br>confirmed cases of influenza A/H1N1 and 1,462 deaths. <br>India was no exception and many deaths (138 as of 9 <br>September 2009) were reported in metropolitan cities such <br>as Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore.

These recommendations include using tissues <br>when sneezing, washing hands regularly with soap and <br>water. The media, including both televised and written <br>media, and to a lesser extent the radio and the internet, <br>where free uncensored writing and YOU-tube postings take <br>place had led to inappropriate behaviour by the public such <br>as; refusal to comply with precautionary measures, <br>including wearing a mask or accepting a vaccination; <br>avoidance of certain activities including visiting the hospital <br>due to fear of healthcare facilities as a venue for acquiring <br>the infection.8-10 There was a large need for the <br>dissemination of accurate information to overcome the <br>misinformed dialogue taking place on TV, newspapers and <br>internet. 11 During a pandemic, public health agencies can <br>play critical roles in controlling the spread of disease. <br>Therefore the present study was designed to assess the <br>knowledge, attitude and practice during swine flu epidemic <br>among the medical staff and the general population. <br><br> <br><br>Method <br>This cross sectional survey was conducted at a tertiary care <br>centre hospital where the patients are referred from <br>different parts of Haryana accompanied by relatives <br>therefore it was regarded as a potentially high-risk area for <br>the spread of Influenza A   and chosen to assess the <br>knowledge, attitude and practice in relation to swine flu. A <br>self administered questionnaire involved 42 hospital staff <br>members   accompanying <br>the patients from 1st September 2009 to 15th October 2009. <br><br> <br><br>Results <br>A total of 400 subjects (Hospital staff= 42 & general <br>population= 358) with mean   SD age group of 31.42   <br>10.65 years   participated in the study. <br>There were 214 males and 186 females. <br><br> <br><br>Knowledge response <br>Out of all respondents only 25%   had heard of swine <br>flu before. Out of these 25%   <br>hospital staff   <br>knew about symptoms of swine flu. Sixty five percent of HS <br>and thirty seven percent of GP knew more than three <br>correct symptoms. 65% of HS and 74% of GP thought that <br>this was a disease of children and elderly patients, while <br>35% of HS and 22% of GP thought that adults with co <br>morbidities like asthma and diabetes were at a greater risk <br>and only 2% of GP didn t know about it. There were 95% HS <br>and 86% general people who thought that touching of eyes, <br>nose or mouth without washing hands can spread the <br>disease while only 5% HS and 10% GP thought that it was <br>partially true and 6.66 % of GP didn t know the answer. <br>Altogether, 80% of HS and GP thought that the disease was <br>controllable while, 15% of HS and 10% of GP thought that it <br>was not and 10% of GP didn t know the answer. Nearly 95% <br>of HS and 92% of GP knew about the nearest swine flu <br>control or testing centre and half of HS were aware of the <br><br>second wave of swine flu epidemic but 72% of GP were not <br>aware of it. <br><br> <br><br>Attitude response <br>Only 10% of HS and GP had attended some type of <br>awareness program for swine flu control. Nearly 65% <br>  did not avoid public gatherings like <br>parties and group meetings of the fear of swine flu while <br>rest 35% avoid such meetings. Nearly 70% of respondents <br>  definitely thought that mask <br>prevents the disease and 20%   <br>thought that it was partially true and only 10% (HS=5% & <br>GP=13.33%) didn t know the answer. <br><br> <br><br>Practice response <br>About 98% respondents   wash <br>their hands before having meals. 62% (HS=55% & <br>GP=66.67%) were definitely taking precautions against the <br>spread of swine flu while 14%   were <br>taking <br>partial <br>precautions, <br>while <br>24% <br>(HS=25% <br>& <br><br>GP=23.33%) were not taking any precautions. Disposal of <br>mask was done by throwing them into the dustbin by 34% <br>  while, disposal by burning  was <br>done by 20%. However, 46% <br>  did not know how to dispose masks. Of <br>the respondents 46%   thought that <br>it was not safe to reuse the mask more than once and 3.33% <br>general population thought that this was partially true while <br>40% respondents   did not knew the <br>answer and 12%   answered that <br>mask can be reused. There were 94%   <br>of respondents who thought that if they had developed the <br>symptoms of swine flu then they would have contacted the <br>swine flu centre immediately for diagnosis while only 10% <br>hospital staff thought that they would have taken the <br>proper precautions to prevent the spread of disease and 5% <br>of HS thought that they would have done both. Nearly 94% <br>respondents   used tissue or <br>handkerchief while sneezing or coughing and when the <br>respondents had to visit some swine flu infected area then <br>40%   wash their hands with soap <br>and water more frequently and thoroughly while 40% <br>  respondents avoid contact with the <br>people who appeared sick and 30%   <br>followed the both precautions. <br><br>Discussion <br>In spite of the increase in the number of Influenza A   <br>cases as well as the response of the WHO by raising its <br>pandemic alert status to phase 6 and extensive media <br>coverage, public responses to Influenza A   were <br>muted. In practice, convincing the public that the threat is <br>real is often a more pressing task for public health agencies <br>than providing reassurance. 7 Many reports have examined <br>the various levels of knowledge about infectious agents and <br>public behavior in relation to these infections; such studies <br>have primarily focused on the SARS and avian influenza <br>outbreaks.8, 13 Other studies have been recently published <br>specifically on behavioral and attitudinal responses to <br>pandemic   2009 Influenza.10, 14-16 <br><br> <br> <br><br><image: DeviceRGB, width: 106, height: 125, bpc: 8><br>Australasian Medical Journal AMJ 2010, 3, 9, 614-617 <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>In our study nearly 75% of the respondents had never heard <br>of the swine flu before out of which 99.33% were of general <br>population and only 0.67% were of medical staff. Out of <br>which 52% knew more than three symptoms. In another <br>study by Kamate et al 83% of subjects had heard about <br>swine flu. In another study 44% of national sample of adult <br>Australians reported having knowledge of the term <br>pandemic influenza,18 a finding similar to that of a study <br>conducted in the USA in 2006 in which 41% of respondents <br>had previously heard of this term. So here we conclude <br>that our respondents have far less knowledge about swine <br>flu than the above studies and the reason may be lack of <br>public health communications. <br><br> <br><br>In our study nearly 72 % of respondents learned about <br>swine flu from television while about 20% came to know <br>about the disease in newspapers and only 8% through word <br>of mouth. Similarly in an another study the majority   <br>of the participants received their information about swine <br>flu from the television; 51.1% received information from <br>written media such as newspapers and magazines, while <br>48.2% received information from the internet. <br><br> <br><br>In a recent review of behavioural responses to influenza <br>pandemics in the 20th century,20 the only two measures <br>that had strong support by scientific literature to lessen the <br>spread of the diseases were hand hygiene and respiratory <br>etiquette. School closure and screening of travellers had <br><br>reduced the use of public transportation; 74.3% had not <br>taken any time off work; However, more than half the <br>respondents   avoided crowded places and <br>54.6% washed their hands with soap and water more often <br>than usual, and 63.6% were not overtly worried about <br>cleaning or disinfecting things that they might touch. <br><br> <br><br>Nearly 70% of the respondents believed that using masks <br>definitely prevents swine flu while 20% were not sure <br>whether masks could prevent from the disease and 10% <br>didn t knew the answer. Nearly 34% disposed the used  <br>mask by throwing it into dustbin, 20% disposed them by <br>burning and 46% did not know how to dispose the masks. In <br>another study the willingness to wear a mask during a <br>pandemic was surprisingly high, particularly as this is <br>not common practice in Australia. Use of masks by the <br>general public in China, Hong Kong, Special Administrative <br>Region, during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome <br>  outbreak was below this level. <br><br> <br><br>Eighty percent of our respondents definitely thought that <br>the disease was controllable while 10% thought that this <br>was partially true while in an another study two percent of <br>the respondents were of the opinion that Influenza A <br>  would not affect their health; 36.4% feared  that <br>they would be somewhat affected; 34.5% believed that they <br>would be seriously affected; and 27.1% had no idea about <br>the effect of Influenza A   on their health. <br><br>legal and ethical  consequences when  implemented.  While <br>  <br> <br><br>the other four measures, including isolation and wearing of <br>a surgical mask or an N95 mask, had cost effectiveness <br>concerns and would be difficult to implement over long <br>periods of time.21, 22 Maximum of the respondents   <br>thought that swine flu can be spread by poor hygiene like <br>touching eyes, nose or mouth without washing their hands <br>and actually 98% of respondents washed their hands before <br>meals while nearly 94% use tissue or handkerchief while <br>coughing or sneezing. In another study nearly, one-third <br>reported avoiding touching their eyes, nose, or mouth <br>  and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue <br>when coughing or sneezing. However, only onefourth <br>of participants reported throwing the tissue in the <br>trash after use   and avoiding normal activities if they <br>have flulike symptoms  .17 <br><br> <br><br>It is important to know what proportion of the population is <br>concerned about contracting a disease since those who are <br>concerned would be expected to take more precautions. In <br>a telephone-assisted survey of 2,081 adults above the age  <br>of 16 years, the New South Wales Department of Health <br>found that only 48.3% of those interviewed were willing to <br>comply with precautionary measures.23,24 In our study <br>nearly 66% responded that they did not avoid public <br>gatherings like parties or group meetings but 40% of the <br>respondents washed their hand with soap and water <br>thoroughly and more frequently when they visit swine flu <br>infected areas while, 40% avoided close contact with the <br>people who appeared unwell.
