respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus disease, and the Zika virus infection.", "The situation in resource-limited countries is really grave due to growing panic and fear, especially in the absence of clear management guidelines and definitive treatment.", "Although initially some of these infections have been confined to particular geographical areas such as the MERS-Corona virus infection in the middle-east, ZIKV in South America, and Ebola virus disease in the Western Africa, but the situation may become really serious due to rapid globalization, international migration, and relatively easy travel to and from these afflicted countries resulting in the dissemination of these infections to newer countries.", "The affected cases may travel to other countries where the infection may not have been present and eventually lead to the spread of the pandemic.", "Most remarkable among all these infections is the infection by ZIKV maintained in a life cycle that mainly includes monkeys and apes with humans as occasional hosts, but on the other hand, the Asian lineage of ZIKV includes humans as the main host."]]}, {"title": "Epidemiology", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["Since its isolation from Uganda, it has been reported to be associated with sporadic human infections in Africa and Asia.", "The most remarkable details are available from the epidemic that occurred in Yap Island,

Verde, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Saint Martin, Samoa, Suriname, and Venezuela."], ["Transmission ZIKV transmission to human takes place mostly via the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito which breeds in fresh standing water and usually bite during the daytime   also have the potential to spread the virus."], ["Few cases of person to person presumptive sexual transmission of ZIKV have been reported in women who had sexual intercourse with the partners suffering from the ZIKV illness."], ["Researchers have also confirmed the presence of the ZIKV RNA in semen of the affected male giving the hypothesis of sexual spread of the ZIKV illness."], ["ZIKV RNA has also been detected in blood, urine, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, amniotic fluid, and breast milk."], ["Maternal to fetal transmission can occur, as the virus can cross the placental barrier resulting in congenital infection and also intrapartum transmission can occur.", "ZIKV transmission through breastfeeding has not yet been described, and thus it is recommended that the affected mothers continue to breastfeed their babies."]]}, {"title": "Clinical Manifestations", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["typically occur approximately 2-12 days after the Aedes mosquito bite and

infection in infants and children present with similar signs and symptoms as that of adults.", "Arthralgia in infants usually manifests as the child being irritable, walking with a limp, having difficulty in moving or refusing to move an extremity, or pain with active or passive movement of the affected joint or on palpation of the joint."]]}, {"title": "Complications", "sequence": "",

association of the virus infection with microcephaly in the newborn and even infant death.", "The cases of muscular atrophy have also been observed in children with microcephaly born after the onset of the ZIKV outbreak in Brazil."], ["ZIKV infection acquired during pregnancy is associated with poor outcomes of the fetus, which includes central nervous system injury, placental insufficiency, in

manifestations include the reports of acute myelitis and meningoencephalitis associated with detection of ZIKV in the CSF."], ["Moreover, there is a report of ankle edema, axillary and/or inguinal lymphadenopathy, leukopenia with monocytosis, and thrombocytopenia from the cases of ZIKV infection in travelers from Italy."], ["Symptoms and signs of ZIKV infection occur only in about 20% cases infected with the majority of the patients being asymptomatic.", "The common symptoms are similar to those of DENV and chikungunya virus infections and include the acute onset of low-grade fever with

the diagnosis."], ["The medical literature has studies suggesting that the ZIKV RNA can be detected in urine, and saliva of the patients for a longer duration than the serum by the RT-PCR method."],

elimination and prevention of mosquito bites.", "The sexual mode of transmission can be avoided by the use of barrier methods or abstinence from sexual intercourse."], ["Mosquito bites can be prevented by wearing long sleeve shirt and pants, use of insect repellent, and being indoors as much as possible."], ["Aedes mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, thus found in abundance in places of on-going construction.", "Moreover, these mosquitoes are commonly found in tropical and sub-tropical areas, making Asian countries an endemic zone for growth of Aedes.", "Environmental control

states of India in the year 1952-1953 reported the neutralizing antibodies in the sera to certain viruses including ZIKV in the Indians.", "This detection could well be due to cross reactivity among different Flavivirus antibody assays.", "However, the recent reports from Bangladesh are alarming where the first case of ZIKV infection in a 67-year-old male has been detected.", "The problem of ZIKV could become really grave in Asian countries due to warm and humid conditions which are ideal for the mosquito vector breeding.", "In these resources-strained countries where the per capita income is low and there is a meagre contribution from the government s annual health budget, the emergence of ZIKV could only add to the woes.", "Moreover, in the absence of clear guidelines, management strategies, and cure, the proper dissemination of the healthcare information about the ZIKV is imperative, and thus the role of all the stakeholders, including clinicians, healthcare workers, the general public, government agencies, NGO s such as the HIFA2015 is very important."]]}, {"title": "Zika Virus Epidemic Concerns", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["The outbreak of ZIKV infection in
