attitudes and perceived behavioural control were twice as likely to wash their hands properly.", "Several studies have used the knowledge, attitudes, and practices approach to examine the influence of school children s knowledge, attitudes, and practices on hygiene behaviour; they have reported mixed results concerning the importance of knowledge in determining proper handwashing behaviour.",

seemed most promising were selected for the three behavioural determinants with the highest intervention potentials in each country.", "In addition to these quantitative results, observational findings on school handwashing characteristics revealed that in many schools, soap, and in some even water, were not available for handwashing on the day of the field visit.", "Furthermore, in Burundi, there were on average over 250 students per handwashing facility.", "#is pupil-to-handwashing-facility ratio exceeds the international guidelines, which recommend one handwashing facility per 50 100 students.", "#ese survey data served as a basis for developing a programme based on informational, infrastructural, and normative interventions with the overall goal of supporting and guiding all participants towards established handwashing habits.", "#e behaviour change techniques selected are meant to create personal awareness for washing hands with soap and water, raise the actual

seriousness of contracting diarrhoea consist of messages about the causes of diarrhoea and the consequences of the disease, creating the precondition for change.", "Teachers are trained to sensitize the children on the issue of diarrhoea, using posters depicting transmission routes of diarrhoea pathogens, a description of the handwashing steps, and recommendations for situations in which washing hands is critical, along with risk factors, signs, and symptoms of diarrhoea.", "Infrastructural interventions are proposed to enhance the children s self-efficacy and thus their confidence in their ability to perform the behaviour.", "Each classroom should be equipped with a simple handwashing device along with a dispenser filled with soapy solution.", "As a short-term solution, soap should be provided for the duration of the project.", "A strategy already pursued in the province of Nogzi, Burundi is that children bring water if the school does not have a water source.", "As a longterm solution, income-generating activities should be discussed with the schools, policy dialogues at provincial and ministerial level should aim at the allocation of funds for soap, and advocacy is needed to assure the availability of water in schools.", "An intervention highlighting the commonness of handwashing at every school is suggested to tackle social norms.", "A kick-off event to introduce the new handwashing stations should be organized.", "#e inauguration could be accompanied by a handwashing song, and each class should create handwashing posters serving as a public commitment to being a handwashing class.", "Discussion", "In this article we describe an application of the RANAS systematic approach to behaviour change for the development of a school handwashing programme for primary school children in a rural and an urban setting in two sub-Saharan African countries.", "#e results of the regression analyses revealed that the RANAS behavioural determinants predicted children s self-reported handwashing frequencies very well in both countries.", "In Burundi, high reported handwashing frequencies after using the toilet were best predicted by a high perceived severity of diarrhoea, the perception that many other children wash hands at school too, and a strong confidence in one s abilities to always perform the behaviour.", "In Zimbabwe, the behavioural determinants with the highest predictive value proved also to include the perception that other children wash hands at school too, the confidence in one s abilities to always perform the behaviour, and, moreover, paying a lot of attention to always washing hands after using the toilet at school.", "#e findings in this study are consistent with the results of studies conducted with primary caregivers of young children in Haiti and southern Ethiopia showing that the relevant significant behavioural determinants from the present regression analyses were also predictive of self-reported handwashing.", "In Bogot, Colombia, school children also reported higher subjective norms and higher perceived control when their intention to wash hands properly was high.", "School children in Selat sub-district, Indonesia were also more likely to wash hands properly when their perceived behavioural control was high.", "#e results from Burundi and Zimbabwe indicate an overall lack of awareness of hygiene issues in both countries.", "Low norms for handwashing and the children s low perceived ability are consistent with the lack of adequate infrastructure at the schools.", "#e improvement potentials calculated suggest that an intervention targeting social norms and self-efficacy should be most effective in both countries.", "Additionally, in Burundi, children that do not perceive diarrhoea as severe should be targeted by the intervention.", "In Zimbabwe, children with less knowledge of diarrhoea and disease transmission should profit from the proposed programme.", "Based on these results and taking into consideration the observational findings on the school handwashing characteristics, a school handwashing programme was developed that fit the target groups.", "#e interventions of the programme aim to create awareness of the benefits of handwashing through educational activities, raise children s ability and confidence to wash hands at school through infrastructural improvements, and highlight the commonness of handwashing at school through events and poster creation.", "Several studies have been able to show that raising awareness for the importance of handwashing and increasing hygiene knowledge leads to an improvement in proper handwashing.", "Moreover, the presence of handwashing stands at school has been found to be associated with proper handwashing, and providing soapy water has been shown to raise the frequency of handwashing practices at school.", "By introducing the new hardware with a big event and because of the continuous use of the handwashing stations by all children, the behaviour should become common practice, increasing the descriptive norm at each school and enhancing the children s self-efficacy through facilitation of the behaviour.", "Limitations #e results should be viewed with the caution necessary with self-reported behaviours.", "Several studies have shown that self-report overestimates handwashing behaviour when compared to observed frequencies.", "However, collecting observed data on all children included in this study would have been very difficult and costly and extremely time-consuming.", "In addition, the operationalization of the behavioural determinants can be criticized because they were measured with only one item.", "Even though we do not have reliability indicators for the survey items, keeping the questionnaire short was necessary to keep the children motivated to participating in the survey.", "#e present study is cross-sectional, so that relationships between variables are descriptive and do not imply causality.", "However, the results of the regression analyses have been confirmed by previous work focusing on caregivers handwashing practices.", "Conclusions #e RANAS systematic approach to behaviour change allowed us to determine the relative importance of the behavioural determinants underlying school children s handwashing practices and thus to select appropriate behaviour change techniques.", "Several reviews of health promotion programmes have concluded that the quality of an intervention is increased by the use of methods derived from social-cognitive theories.", "#e findings of this study strongly suggest that similar handwashing programmes providing education on handwashing issues along with adequate infrastructure could induce
