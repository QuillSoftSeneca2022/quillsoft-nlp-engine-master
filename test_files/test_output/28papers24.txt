Title: of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Asymptomatic Orthopoxvirus Circulation in Humans in the Wake of a Monkeypox Outbreak among Chimpanzees in Cameroon
/***********************************************************************/
Abstract: Monkeypox virus is a zoonotic Orthopoxvirus that causes smallpox-like illness in humans. In Cameroon, human monkeypox cases were confrmed in two thousand and eighteen and outbreaks in captive chimpanzees occurred in two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen We investigated the OPXV serological status among staff at a primate sanctuary   and residents from nearby villages, and describe contact with possible monkeypox reservoirs. We focused specifcally on Gambian rats because it is a recognized possible reservoir and because contact with this species was common enough to render suffcient statistical power. We collected one five-mL whole blood specimen from each participant to perform a generic anti-OPXV ELISA test for IgG and IgM antibodies and administered a questionnaire about prior symptoms of monkeypox-like illness and contact with possible reservoirs. Our results showed evidence of OPXV exposures among some of those too young to have received smallpox vaccination. No participants reported prior symptoms consistent with monkeypox. After adjusting for the education level, participants who frequently visited the forest were more likely to have recently eaten Gambian rats and primate sanctuary staff were less likely to have touched or sold Gambian rats. The asymptomatic or undetected circulation of OPXVs in humans in Cameroon is likely, and contact with monkeypox reservoirs is common, raising the need for continued surveillance for human and animal disease.

		Monkeypox virus, which also includes Variola, Cowpox, and Vaccinia viruses. Orthopoxviruses provide immunological cross-protection such that infection with one OPXV or I ammunization with Vaccinia virus provides some degree of protection against the others in the genus. twelve Since the eradication of smallpox in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty there have been increasing OPXV outbreaks among both animals and humans, suggesting a shift in the ecology and evolution of OPXVs simultaneous with diminishing smallpox vaccine derived immunity. Monkeypox virus is endemic in West and Central Africa, and human infections are more frequently recognized. four In its most severe form, the clinical presentation of monkeypox is similar to that of smallpox, causing rashes following a prodromal period of fever, malaise, headache, and lymphadenopathy. seven The gravity of monkeypox disease is determined by the exposure route, the strain and dose of the infecting virus, and the baseline health status of the patient. Of the two viral clades, the Congo Basin clade is thought to have more severe disease presentation than the West African clade. eighty nine Monkeypox is on the rise in West and Central Africa, and in Cameroon, there have been a number of epidemiologic and epizootic events related to this emerging zoonosis. four Historical human cases have been noted in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy nine in Ekidmekoe village, in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty in the city of Moloundou, and in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty nine in * Address correspondence to Sarah Anne J.

The reservoir a mystery, but current data suggest small mammals are involved in sylvatic circulation and maintenance of the virus1seven and subsequent introduction to human populations. Monkeypox virus has only been isolated twice from wild animals: once from a rope squirrel in the Democratic Republic of Congo in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty five and once from a sooty mangabey in Co te d Ivoire in two thousand and twelve one thousand, eight hundred and nineteen Ecologic investigations from Ghana and DRC showed that animals most likely to have anti-OPXV antibodies included those of the genera Graphiurus, Cricetomys. Lemniscomys have also been implicated, in addition to Oenomys hypoxanthus and Petrodromus tetradactylus in particular have been repeatedly associated with MPXV, either through detection of anti-OPXV antibodies or MPXV DNA. one thousand, seven hundred and twenty twenty two Falendysz and others describe Gambian rats as possessing characteristics of a typical reservoir that is, they have the ability to amplify and transmit virus, without the appearance of serious disease. In West and Central Africa, two GUAGLIARDO AND OTHERS hunting, selling, and preparing of wild game/ bushmeat are commonplace,twofour and contact with these wild animal reservoirs through hunting and preparation of meat is presumed to be a risk factor for monkeypox infection. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with infected bodily fluids, such as blood, salivary/respiratory droplets, and lesion exudates and crusts. The purpose of this report was to describe the seroprevalence of OPXVs in humans in Mfou district, Cameroon, and to explore the frequency and type of contact with bushmeat, with focus on Gambian rats. An improved understanding of transmission of OPXVs, the extent of subclinical disease, and risk factors associated with infection will inform the local prevention and response to this serious public health threat.

		Study area. The investigation was conducted in Mfou district, in the central region of Cameroon, and was carried out at a primate sanctuary, in addition to four nearby villages: Metet, Nzdefdi, Ndangueng I, and Nkilzok I. This region was selected as the site for the investigation because it is the primate sanctuary that had experienced a monkeypox outbreak in captive chimpanzees in two thousand and sixteen The most recent national census in two thousand and eleven estimated the Mfou district population to be seventy one thousand, three hundred and seventy three individuals, the majority of whom are employed as traders and farmers. The capital of Mfou district is a town by the same name, located about twenty five km south of Yaounde. Study design. This investigation used a cross-sectional design with two cohorts including staff employed at the primate sanctuary and residents from the four villages mentioned earlier. The study was carried out in October two thousand and seventeen approximately one year after the chimpanzee outbreak. On arrival in each of the fve study locations, park staff or community members attended an educational session about monkeypox. Afterward, adults aged 2" eighteen years were invited to participate in the project which consisted of a questionnaire and blood sample collection. All communication was conducted in French, English, or local languages, as necessary. Participants were compensated for their participation and, at any time, could choose to stop the questionnaire or blood draw. This investigation was determined to be public health nonresearch by the delegated authority at CDC s National Center for Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases (protocol number

		). The investigation protocol was approved by the Cameroonian Ministry of Health, in addition to a Cameroonian Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was acquired from each participant. Questionnaire. Questionnaires consisted of paper surveys administered in French or a local language by representatives of the Ministry of Health. Information was collected on participant demographics, socioeconomic status, education, and contact with wildlife. Participants were shown photos of animals that are possible MPXV hosts and were asked whether they had contact with these animals within ten months before the survey administration   were then included in multivariable models, using a backward selection stepwise procedure to identify relevant predictors. When two similar variables were both signifcant in the univariable modeling step, the model with the best ft was selected for further analysis. For multivariable models, a backward stepwise procedure was used to determine the best model in proc hpgnselect, with an entry criterion of P = 0.ten and a selection criterion of P = zero point zero eight Model assumptions were evaluated using collinearity diagnostics; a condition index less than fifteen was presumed to reflect independence of predictor variables.

		Study population. Participants included forty five employees from the primate sanctuary and eighty participants from the four nearby villages. Participant ages ranged from eighteen to eighty three years; fifty point eight percent  were born after routine smallpox vaccination ceased in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty The average household size was five point eight two individuals. In comparison with community members, park employees were more likely to be male, more educated, and reported less frequent forest visits. The most common occupations among the eighty community members included farming, homemakers, farming and some other occupation. Analysis of associations between seropositivity and survey outcomes was not possible because of the low numbers of seropositive individuals. We characterized relationships between the fve outcome variables and demographic, socioeconomic, and educational variables. Variables that approached statistical signifcance in the bivariate analyses were input into univariable logistic regression models, using the cohort as the clustering variable in a repeated measures term in proc genmod in SAS. Selected predictor variables (P < zero point one in caregivers, such as veterinarians and keepers, and other types of workers including masons, maintenance staff, and security guards.

		Serological results. The proportion of individuals who were IgG positive for anti-OPXV antibodies was thirty four point four percent. Among the sixty three participants less than the age of smallpox vaccination cutoff, four. Notably, however, one of these participants had a very low IgG value of zero point zero two One participant from the village of Metet tested IgM positive for anti-OPXV antibodies, indicating a recent OPXV exposure. This individual had reported frequent venturing into the forest, Gambian rats,

		Bold denotes statistical signifcance. In total, one hundred and twenty five individuals participated in the investigation, including forty five primate sanctuary employees and eighty community members. Signifcant demographic differences were observed between these two cohorts. * Routine smallpox vaccinations in Africa ceased in one thousand, nine hundred and eighty Persons aged less than or equal to thirty seven years at the time of enrollment in this study were not expected to have had the opportunity for childhood vaccination to protect against smallpox. Fisher s exact test, P-value. and rope squirrels. Although study participants reported encounters with a diversity of animals, our analysis specifcally focused on modeling contact with Gambian rats. Variables that were considered in the univariable logistic regression models predicting different modes of contact with Gambian rats included age, gender, sampling location, population, education completed, household size, and forest visits. Univariable regression models showed that participants with no formal education were signifcantly more likely to report any type of contact with Gambian rats, in addition to selling/touching, preparing, and eating. Park staff members were less likely to engage in hunting, selling/ touching, or having any type of contact with Gambian rats. Multivariable modeling showed that when adjusting for the level of education, participants reporting more than one visit to the forest per week were three point three six times as likely as those reporting < one visit to the forest per week to have recently eaten Gambian rats. In comparison with community members, primate sanctuary staff were zero point two three times as likely to have recently touched or sold Gambian rats, when accounting for the level of education. All model assumptions were satisfed.

	Title: DISCUSSION
	Sequence: 4
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		We identifed the presence of anti-OPXV antibodies in participants less than the age of smallpox vaccination in Mfou district, Cameroon, suggesting undetected or possible asymptomatic circulation of an OPXV in human populations in this region. Although the ELISA used in this study is a generic OPXV test, we postulate that MPXV is the most likely culprit because of the historical cases in humans and in chimpanzees in Mfou, Cameroon,one0,one6 and because it is the only OPXV reported in humans in Africa. Even so, it is still possible that the anti-OPXV antibodies detected here are the result of exposures from a different, possibly unknown/ cryptic OPXV. Taterapox virus, for example, is another. Our analysis of animal exposures showed notable differences in animal contact patterns among park staff and people from surrounding towns. This could be attributable to differences in formal education, attitudes about conservation, and/or socioeconomic status. For example, the park has a strong tradition of conservation, likely discouraging its employees from hunting or poaching wild animals. A higher level of education was associated with not eating Gambian rats, and selling or touching Gambian rats was more likely to occur among villagers with an intermediate level of education. This could be because merchants selling wild game may have some degree of formal education, or alternatively, individuals with lower levels of education may be poorer and, therefore, more likely to consume wild game they have hunted. Other works have shown a positive correlation between bushmeat consumption and wealth,33 but the relationship between socioeconomic status and bushmeat consumption is complex in the context of an Ebola outbreak, for example, bushmeat consumption among lowincome households decreased signifcantly more than in high-income households. Further investigation is required to more precisely describe the relationships between socioeconomic status and behaviors surrounding the consumption of wild game in Cameroon. Among villagers, we found contact with wildlife to be common, with near ubiquitous contact with porcupines. In addition to reports of hunting porcupines noted in our survey data, which reflects the popularity of this protein source, we also anecdotally observed the abundance of porcupine meat in local restaurants. Research from Nigeria,35 Gabon,36 and the DRC2one have similarly identifed porcupines as a common food source. As other researchers have noted,2one serological surveys of porcupines could be used to determine whether they may serve as a potential reservoir of MPXV and other zoonoses. After adjusting for the level of education in both models, we found that people visiting the forest > one time per week were three point four times as likely to have recently eaten Gambian rats. Being an employee of the primate sanctuary was protective against selling/touching Gambian rats. * Reference categories are reported in parentheses. The variable population refers to whether the participant was a community member or an employee of the primate sanctuary.

		Some limitations of our analysis of animal exposures should be noted. First, as in other OPXV serosurveys,20,31,32 we used age as a proxy for receipt of smallpox vaccination. None of the participants under the age cutoff reported a history of smallpox vaccination, but it is still possible that participants misreported their age. Our population consisted of a targeted convenience sample only individuals who were present in communities on arrival of study staff were able to participate. It is therefore possible that our sample of participants is not representative of the population in this region. Other sources of possible bias might include social desirability. Future public health responses to monkeypox could strengthen monkeypox prevention efforts by enhancing training in clinical case recognition, case management, infection prevention and control, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, and epidemiological reporting.
