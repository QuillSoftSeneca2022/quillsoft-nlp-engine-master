{"title": "2608 jvi.asm.org Journal of Virology p", "abstract": "Viruses in the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera have been associated with large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in human and nonhuman primates. The first documented cases occurred in primates over  years ago, but the amount of virus genetic diversity detected within bat populations, which have recently been identified as potential reservoir hosts, suggests that the filoviruses are much older. Here, detailed Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analyses are performed on  whole-genome sequences,  of which are newly reported, to comprehensively examine molecular evolutionary rates and estimate dates of common ancestry for viruses within the family Filoviridae. Molecular evolutionary rates for viruses belonging to different species range from 0.6 X - nucleotide substitutions/site/year for Sudan ebolavirus to  X - nucleotide substitutions /site/year for Reston ebolavirus. Most recent common ancestry can be traced back only within the last  years for Reston ebolavirus and Zaire ebolavirus species and suggests that viruses within these species may have undergone recent genetic bottlenecks. Viruses within Marburg marburgvirus and Sudan ebolavirus species can be traced back further and share most recent common ancestors approximately  and  years before the present, respectively. Examination of the whole family suggests that members of the Filoviridae, including the recently described Lloviu virus, shared a most recent common ancestor approximately  years ago. These data will be valuable for understanding the evolution of filoviruses in the context of natural history as new reservoir hosts are identified and, further, for determining mechanisms of emergence, pathogenicity, and the ongoing threat to public health.", "autors": [{"firstname": "Serena", "middlename": "A", "surname": "Carroll"}, {"firstname": "Jonathan", "middlename": "S", "surname": "Towner"}, {"firstname": "Tara", "middlename": "K", "surname": "Sealy"}, {"firstname": "Laura", "middlename": "K", "surname": "Mcmullan"}, {"firstname": "Marina", "middlename": "L", "surname": "Khristova"}, {"firstname": "Felicity", "middlename": "J", "surname": "Burt"}, {"firstname": "Robert", "middlename": "", "surname": "Swanepoel"}, {"firstname": "Pierre", "middlename": "E", "surname": "Rollin"}, {"firstname": "Stuart", "middlename": "T", "surname": "Nichola"}], "blocks": [{"title": "", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["found to be seropositive for Reston virus yet reported no clinical symptoms.", "Finally, Ta Forest virus has been described only in a single nonfatal human case.", "Marburg and Ravn virus infections can result in case fatalities ranging from approximately 20% to 90%.", "Genetic investigations of filovirus outbreaks have found them to be of two general types, those that are the result of a single introduction into the human population followed by person-toperson spread and those outbreaks that result from multiple introductions followed by short chains of human transmission.", "During person-to-person transmission, there appears to be little Over the past 10 years, filovirus RNA and antibodies have been detected in several bat species, but it was not until 2007 that Marburg and Ravn virus isolates were recovered from Egyptian fruit bats associated with a small outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in southwestern Uganda.", "In contrast to the low virus genetic diversity observed with person-to-person virus transmission during human outbreaks, potential bat reservoir populations appear to harbor genetically diverse virus populations at single geographical locations.", "Although the filoviruses are thought to have originated quite some time ago, age estimates have ranged from a few thousand years ago.", "Further confusing the issue, some authors have presented data indicating that viruses of at least one filovirus species in the very recent past.", "Previous studies have attempted to estimate rates of nonsynonymous substitutions and divergence times among viruses within the Filoviridae; however, most have been limited in terms of sample size or have examined only a single species, in particular, Zaire ebolavirus.", "Here, we perform detailed Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analyses on 97 virus whole-genome sequences   to comprehensively examine the evolutionary rates of the filoviruses and estimate dates of common ancestry within this family.", "Such information is valuable for understanding the evolution of viruses in this family in the context of natural history, pathogenicity, and ongoing threat."], ["MATERIALS AND METHODS Viral RNA extraction, reverse transcription-PCR, and wholegenome sequencing by primer walking were performed as previously described or as follows, with primers specific for each virus species.", "The Ebola virus genome was amplified in seven overlapping RT-PCR fragments.", "The Sudan virus genome was amplified in five overlapping fragments, with a few exceptions.", "In some cases, fragment A was amplified in 2 smaller fragments.", "In other cases, nested reactions were performed using the original fragment primers found in Table S1 in the supplemental material for the first round and a second set of primers   likely undergoing recent genetic bottlenecks.", "The processes contributing to the genetic bottlenecks of these viruses, yet not those of others, remain unknown and highlight the importance of examining the biology of the filoviruses as well as their distinct reservoir hosts.", "As we learn more about the reservoirs of the other filoviruses, we will be able to use characteristics of the hosts to make predictions regarding the viruses.", "For example, the range of the virus will depend on the range of the host to some extent, along with other external abiotic factors that influence the host directly.", "Furthermore, virus evolution clearly depends on the host for the number of susceptible hosts available for the virus to infect, the number of potential opportunities that a virus has for transmission due to the social or sexual interactions of the host species, and more.", "Much work remains to decipher exactly how these viruses have evolved over time and in relation to their host species."]]}, {"title": "RESULTS", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": []}]}
