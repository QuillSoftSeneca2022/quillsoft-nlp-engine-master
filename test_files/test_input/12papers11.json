to our center, out of which, highest number of sample was received from Raipur district followed by Durg district, which was comparable with the incidence of human influenza infection in the district of Rajasthan."], ["Among these samples 07.9% was seropositive for all three subtypes of influenza virus such as Influenza-A, H1N1, and H1 Subtype."], ["The incidence of Influenza-A was 46.3%, H1N1,

significant difference in between gender affected by human influenza, while Influenza A was more common than H1N1 and H1 subtype among the all received samples.", "The treatment remains the same for
