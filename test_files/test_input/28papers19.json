scientific standpoint, reactions to fear are normal and potentially beneficial, and given the nature of Ebola, fear of the disease during the 2013 2016 outbreak was understandable, not to mention almost universal.", "The Ebola virus is undetectable to the human senses and no disease symptoms appear for days following infection.", "These stealthy traits evoke fear and dread, as do the fearsome symptoms of the disease when they eventually appear.", "Some early publichealth campaigns, with stark messages like Ebola Kills and unnerving visuals of things like fanged fruit bats, contributed to public fear as well.", "Those who did make it to proper care facilities experienced suffering and death in close proximity, isolated from supportive family members, their only human contact coming in the form of healthcare workers covered in special protective gear.", "Furthermore, some fear-related behaviors were based on myths and misconceptions, primarily related to modes of transmission.", "In addition to fear, epidemics which become pandemics when they cross borders and spread throughout whole regions, as the Ebola epidemic did can also trigger serious psychosocial consequences, which fear can then exacerbate.", "These derive from experiences of trauma, loss, and change and include individual psychological consequences like stress, grief, and mental disorders.", "Also included are social consequences like stigma and discrimination, the interruption social networks, and severe shortages of basic necessities.", "Such trauma might take the form of seeing others die or fearing death oneself, especially if infected.", "But, during the Ebola outbreak, people experienced trauma in other forms, as well, such as the re-traumatizing experience of reliving the harsh realities of mass fatalities, regional instability, and community violence in nations that were still grappling with the psychological aftermath of barbaric civil wars.", "Larger changes occurring in communities from discrimination against survivors to movement restrictions, curfews, and quarantines contributed to the psychosocial impact as well."], ["Fear and the spread of Ebola One of the most devastating consequences of fearrelated behaviors during the Ebola outbreak was the decision of infected persons to avoid treatment centers in favor of home care, which inevitably accelerated the spread of the disease.", "By remaining in the community, they decreased their personal chances for survival, while also increasing their encounters with others, who were then more susceptible to infection.", "There were also reports that a number of admitted patients, after witnessing suffering around them, fled from the treatment units, carrying the disease back into the community.", "More common, family members of persons with Ebola symptoms fearfully sequestered their ill relatives out of sight in their homes rather than admit them to newly erected treatment centers.", "Abject fear of these facilities was understandable.", "Outsiders saw Ebola patients enter but only a fraction reemerged alive.", "Meanwhile, a steady stream of body bags exited the premises and relatives were prohibited from reclaiming the corpses.", "Failure to communicate with family members regarding the operations of the treatment centers contributed to the fear.", "The alternative option, secretly caring for symptomatic patients in home settings without proper protective equipment a powerful and prevalent example of fear-related behavior frequently resulted in multiple cases developing within a given household.", "There were also many instances when religious leaders, traditional healers, and family members continued to practice the hands-on body-cleansing rituals and burial practices for persons who had succumbed to Ebola.", "Because corpses of Ebola victims remain highly infectious, many new cases developed in this manner.", "There were also instances in which healthcare workers treated Ebola patients in their homes or in private clinics without proper protection and did not refer these patients to isolation units or treatment centers.", "By late 2014, the problem of home deaths spurred the US Centers for Disease Control to launch its rapid anthropological assessment of the phenomenon.", "After conducting a series of focus groups and key informant interviews, the rapid response team identified a litany of factors associated with delayed care-seeking and home deaths, including concerns about quality of care in treatment centers, lack of information about these BULLETIN OF THE ATOMIC SCIENTISTS 3 units, strong opposition to cremation, concerns about Ebola stigma, fear of household quarantine, fear about lack of food for the family while under quarantine restrictions, and limited access to health services for non-Ebola illnesses.", "As a testament to the prominence of fear-related behaviors, the team acknowledged that decisions about whether or not to seek health care or report a loved one s death were taken amid fears and distrust of public health response efforts, contributing to the incidence of home deaths in the Liberian county being surveyed."]]}, {"title": "Fear as an impediment to treatment", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["On the other side of the equation, fear also affected the medical treatment that was offered.", "Hundreds of healthcare workers provided care tirelessly and risked their lives in the process, particularly in the early months when protective gear was in short supply and protocols for proper use of the equipment had not been taught.", "Many health professionals became afflicted with the Ebola disease themselves, and 58 percent of them died, a rate that was 50 percent higher than for patients from the general population.", "This altruistic behavior was a display of heroism in the face of extreme risk and emphatically not an illustration of a fear-based reaction to the outbreak.", "However, fear-related behaviors did play a prominent role in decreasing access to life-saving care.", "Some healthcare workers opted to vacate their professional roles rather than risk personal illness, death, and possible transmission to family members.", "Given the circumstances, this should not have been surprising: Research has shown that healthcare workers are especially concerned about working during virulent infectious disease outbreaks, and some indicate they will abandon their profession.", "During the 2013 2016 Ebola outbreak, there were instances where health workers refused to work or took extended sick leave.", "A number of international nongovernmental organizations also preemptively withdrew their healthcare personnel from working in high-risk settings, causing some health facilities to temporarily shutter when they were needed most.", "Fear-related behaviors took more insidious forms as well.", "Misinformation and misperceptions led to blaming healthcare workers for bringing the epidemic and harming patients at treatment centers.", "Violent, sometimes fatal attacks were perpetrated against health workers and humanitarian personnel.", "Healthcare workers and their family members were sometimes stigmatized and shunned.", "The stigma even reached developed countries, where draconian restrictions were placed on medical professionals who were willing to volunteer vacation time to serve in western Africa only to return home to extended mandatory quarantines.", "This occurred during a time of acute staff shortages in the region, when international volunteer medical personnel were greatly needed."]]}, {"title": "Fear and its ripple effects", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["Fear not only accelerated the spread of Ebola and impeded treatment, but it also caused other serious problems as well, hampering the treatment of nonEbola patients and harming the mental health of individuals and communities.", "The fear-fueled urgency of treating Ebola had the effect of rerouting healthcare personnel and repurposing facilities away from the care of persons with treatable, non-Ebola illnesses.", "On top of that, not only did the demands of treating Ebola severely diminish the healthcare system s capacity, but fear-related behaviors caused citizens with these treatable ailments to forego medical care due to fears of contracting Ebola.", "The consequences were devastating.", "An estimated 10,600 preventable deaths occurred from untreated or inadequately treated cases of malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV almost equivalent to the 11,323 total deaths from Ebola itself.", "Meanwhile, both infant mortality and maternal mortality increased as hospital and professional-attended deliveries declined sharply, and a total of 17,300 children lost one or both parents to the disease.", "In some instances, these orphans were abandoned and not cared for in their communities, an obvious threat to their psychological well-being.", "Fear-related behaviors also put certain subgroups such as Ebola survivors and their households, families of the deceased, burial teams, and healthcare and humanitarian-aid workers at increased risk for mental disorders.", "Ebola survivors seemed to be especially at psychological risk.", "This outbreak was notable for having the most cases and deaths", "but also the most survivors", "more than 17,300.", "Based on the widely held belief that survivors remained infectious and capable of spreading disease, many survivors were shunned and barred from returning to their workplaces, and some were physically assaulted.", "Stigma and discrimination also extended to the family members and households of Ebola survivors.", "These behaviors were particularly ironic since survivors are generally immune from recurrence of the disease.", "As part of a community-engagement strategy, some survivors 4 J.
