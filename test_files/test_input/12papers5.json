influenza A virus subtypes   are the most prevailing strains worldwide.", "Swine influenza was first proposed to be a disease related to human flu during the 1918 flu pandemic, when pigs became ill at the same time as humans.", "The first identification of an influenza virus as a because of disease in pigs occurred about 10 years later, in 1930.", "For the following 60 years, swine influenza strains were almost exclusively H1N1.", "The pathogen that has seized the world s attention has an official name of swine-origin influenza A H1N1, an acronym, a nickname and an apparent birthplace of Mexico."], ["However, direct transmission from pigs to humans is rare; nevertheless, the retention of influenza strains in pigs after these strains have disappeared from the human population might make pigs a reservoir where influenza viruses could persist, later emerging to reinfect humans once human immunity to these strains has declined.", "Food and Agriculture Organisation, has however confirmed that the virus does not spreading through food products and thus possesses no threat to food chain.", "Swine flu spread very rapidly worldwide due to its high human-to-human transmission

important means of infection.", "Transmission may also occur through wild animals, such as wild boar, which can spread the disease between farms.", "People who work with poultry and swine are exclusively at increased risk of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals, and thus constituting a population of human hosts in which zoonosis and reassortment can co-occur.", "Vaccination of these workers against influenza and surveillance for new influenza strains among this population may, therefore, be an important public health measure to combat this illness."], ["Swine influenza spreads from person to person, either by inhaling the virus or by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus, then touching the mouth or nose.", "Infected droplets are expelled into the air through coughing or sneezing."], ["Research suggested that H1N1 swine influenza is about as contagious as the usual human influenza.", "If one person in a household gets swine flu, anywhere from 8% to 19% of household contacts likely will get infected."], ["Moreover, when an infected person coughs or sneezes near a susceptible person, airborne transmission occurs.", "It requires close contact between the infected and recipient persons because droplets do not remain suspended in the air and travel short distances not more than 6 feet.", "There is also potential for transmission through contact with fomites that are contaminated with respiratory or gastrointestinal material.", "Since many patients with swine influenza infection have had diarrhea, the potential for fecal viral shedding and subsequent fecal-oral transmission should be also considered and well-investigated.", "However, susceptibility of ocular, conjunctival, or gastrointestinal infection remains yet unknown.", "Studies have shown that Influenza A virus can survive on hard, nonporous surfaces   for <8-12 h in ambient temperatures.", "Virus persistence on surfaces increases up to 72 h

aspirin therapy and who might be at risk for experiencing Reye syndrome after influenza virus infection; pregnant women, adults and children with chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic,

strains.", "It has a close similarity with H5N1 in terms of causing cytokines burst, fluid secretions into organs leading to the state of breathlessness.", "The neuraminidase genetic segment of the

by sequences alone.", "Low identity of hemagglutinin structures indicates that the degree of community immunity resulting from exposure to similar viruses does not blunt the transmission from one human to another.", "A third molecular marker is a polybasic cleavage site which is a protease site in the viral hemagglutinin.", "This third site plays an important role in the pathogenicity of avian
