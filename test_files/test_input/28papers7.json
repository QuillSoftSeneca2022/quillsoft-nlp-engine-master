obtained previously, further suggesting that the current outbreak in the DRC is due to a single introduction of this novel EBOV variant into the human population.", "In contrast to the similarity between the Boende variant and other equatorial African variants, the gene sequence of the Lokolia isolate showed only 96.8% identity with the West African variants, with 601 mutations as compared

"Discussion", "sequence": "", "paragraphs": [["EVD first emerged in human populations in 1976, causing nearly simultaneous, but unrelated, outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan, inadequate availability of disinfectants and protective equipment, and lack of knowledge of microbiologic hygiene by health care workers, along with local resistance to public health measures proposed by national authorities.", "The second possible reason why EVD outbreaks have been smaller in equatorial Africa is that infection and illness caused by EBOV variants that are characteristic of equatorial Africa, including the variant that emerged in the Boende district, take a different clinical course from those in West Africa, with different epidemiologic consequences.", "We have found that equatorial and West African variants of EBOV are genetically distinct, as did Baize et al.", "In addition, the genetic diversity among equatorial African isolates appears to be low, as compared with the extensive variation, including many nonsynonymous mutations, that has been identified among West African EBOV isolates, even though the equatorial African variants have been collected over a period of nearly four decades.", "Against this background, there is currently no evidence that variants from the two regions are associated with such factors as differences in the infectious period, case fatality rate, or frequency of hemorrhagic disease.", "The third possible explanation for the smaller outbreaks in equatorial Africa, such as the one in the Boende area, is that they have largely occurred in remote forested areas, where the number of human contacts is limited in small populations living at low density, with infrequent or slow connections by road, river, or air.", "This is in contrast to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, where villages, towns, and capital cities are connected by an extensive network of footpaths, dirt roads, and paved highways.", "The West African n engl j med 371;22 nejm.org november 27, 2014"], ["Ebola Virus Disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo road network is international: in the areas where Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have common borders, single ethnic groups inhabit more than one country, and cross-border travel is frequent, for purposes of commerce and to maintain family ties.", "Unlike the outbreak in the Boende area, the West African epidemic has been multinational almost from the start, with the transportation of both patients with EVD and bodies of deceased patients across borders, complicating the organization of public health measures.", "The fourth possible explanation for the smaller outbreaks in equatorial Africa is that the response to Ebola outbreaks has been faster and more effective in the DRC and neighboring countries.", "With the experience of six previous EVD epidemics, the DRC is now well prepared.", "The time that it takes to respond to news of an outbreak has been shortened over the years.", "There is also substantial national expertise in managing EVD outbreaks, including skills in epidemiology, laboratory analysis, and patient care, with readily available international support.", "During the present outbreak, action was quickly taken to inform the affected communities and to assign responsibilities for control measures to village chiefs, religious and social leaders, traditional healers, and medical staff members.", "These actions were coupled with the introduction of basic infection-control measures for example, on the basis of the slogan no family without detergent, hand sanitizers were distributed to all affected communities to help stop transmission.", "Finally, EVD may have spread more widely in West Africa because the human population is less resistant to infection than in equatorial Africa, either because there has been no previous exposure to EBOV or for some other reason.", "This possibility has not yet been investigated because, for example, we currently have little information about the risk that EVD will develop in a person after exposure to EBOV.", "Although none of these possibilities can be ruled out, the third and fourth possibilities appear to be the most plausible on the basis of the current evidence.", "The coming days and weeks will reveal whether the new EBOV variant that was isolated in the Boende area is on the point of being eliminated from the human population, as in previous EVD outbreaks in the DRC.", "Regardless of the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of this outbreak that are associated with the virus or the animal and human host populations, a continuing, comprehensive public health response will be critical for success."]]}]}
