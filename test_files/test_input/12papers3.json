{"title": "Swine Flu -A Comprehensive View", "abstract": "The present article is aimed on comprehensive view of Swine flu. It was first isolated from pigs in  in USA. Pandemic caused by H1N1 in  brought it in limelight. it is a viral respiratory disease caused by viruses that infects pigs, resulting in nasal secretions, barking cough, decreased appetite, and listless behavior. Swine virus consist of eight RNA strands, one strand derived from human flu strains, two from avian strains, and five from swine strains. Swine flu spreads from infected person to healthy person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets contaminated with virus while sneezing or coughing. Two antiviral agents have been reported to help prevent or reduce the effects of swine flu, flu shot and nasal spray. WHO recommended for pandemic period to prevent its future outbreaks through vaccines or non-vaccines means. Antiviral drugs effective against this virus are Tamiflu and Relenza. Rapid antigen testing, DFA testing, viral culture, and molecular testing are used for its diagnosis in laboratory.", "autors": [{"firstname": "Vandana", "middlename": "", "surname": "Singh"}, {"firstname": "Dr", "middlename": "", "surname": ""}, {"firstname": "Meenakshi", "middlename": "", "surname": "Sood"}], "blocks": [{"title": "INTRODUCTION", "sequence": "1.", "paragraphs": [["This article emphasizes on Swine influenza virus which was first isolated from pigs in 1930 in you.", "S.A.,", "It has been noticed that people who are in close proximity to pigs   have been found globally.", "Swine flu strain, causing 2009 pandemic was first seen in Mexico USA.It has been termed novel H1N1 by Researchers, since it is mainly found infecting people and it exhibits two main surface antigens,H1 and N1.", "By June 2009, the virus had been reported in most countries in the world but luckily, the mortality rate of H1N1 has remained low and similar to that of the conventional flu.", "In 1918 there was an epidemic of \"Spanish flu\" with a mortality rate of around 2-20%, whereas swine flu or H1N1 has mortality rate of less than 6 %.The usual mortality rate for typical influenza is estimated to be less than 0.2 %.", "Swine flu is caused by a type of influenza A virus which is designated as H1N1, it is mainly identified by its surface antigens by immunological techniques.", "This virus is transmitted from person to person either by inhalation or by ingestion of droplets when the infected person sneezes and coughs.", "It is important here to note that Swine flu is not transmitted by eating cooked pork.", "Although the virus was first discovered in 1930 the disease was not observed much until it came into lime light after the pandemic 2009 which affected almost all countries in the world.", "Since then researchers have worked tirelessly on the virus and have come up with several vaccine and nonvaccine measures which can ensure lesser spread of virus", "Copyright 2012 SciResPub.", "and hence lesser chances of such a pandemic in future.", "Complication of H1N1", "though rare could in the form of SARS."]]}, {"title": "I.
