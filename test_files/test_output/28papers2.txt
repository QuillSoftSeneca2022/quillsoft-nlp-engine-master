Title: Clinical aspects of Marburg hemorrhagic fever
/***********************************************************************/
Abstract: Marburg virus belongs to the genus Marburgvirus in the family Filoviridae and causes a severe hemorrhagic fever, known as Marburg hemorrhagic fever, in both humans and nonhuman primates. Similar to the more widely known Ebola hemorrhagic fever, MHF is characterized by systemic viral replication, immunosuppression and abnormal inflammatory responses. These pathological features of the disease contribute to a number of systemic dysfunctions including hemorrhages, edema, coagulation abnormalities and, ultimately, multiorgan failure and shock, often resulting in death. A detailed understanding of the pathological processes that lead to this devastating disease remains elusive, a fact that contributes to the lack of licensed vaccines or effective therapeutics. This article will review the clinical aspects of MHF and discuss the pathogenesis and possible options for diagnosis, treatment and prevention.

		disease process and the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in MHF. Furthermore, the clinical syndromes caused by filoviruses and the associated disease severity may vary depending on several factors such as the medical setting, host susceptibility and genetics and virulence of the viral strain. However, comprehensive clinical data were obtained during both the first outbreak in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty seven and during the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety eight two thousand DRC outbreak, and these form the basis for much of our knowledge about MHF disease progression today. Clinical signs/symptoms during the course of the disease are summarized in. Overall, the incubation period in humans ranges from two to twenty one days, with an average overall incubation period of five nine days. The disease course largely presents in three distinct phases: a generalization phase, an early organ phase and a late organ or convalescence phase, depending on the outcome of infection. The generalization phase begins with influenza like symptoms commencing with a high fever accompanied by a severe headache, chills, myalgia and malaise. This phase potentially lasts until day five after the onset of disease and is accompanied by rapid debilitation. Fatigue, generalized pain and loss of appetite followed by vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and severe watery diarrhea have all been reported. Conjunctivitis, enanthem, dysphagia and pharyngitis are also common. A rash may also appear on the face, trunk and extremities during the middle to late part of the generalization phase and ultimately develops into a maculopapular rash. The disease then progresses into the early organ phase, which is associated with prostration, dyspnea, exanthema and abnormal vascular permeability including conjunctival injection and edema. This early organ phase represents the beginning of the severe phase of the disease. Patients may continue to sustain a high fever through this phase and into the late organ phase and may also display neurological symptoms including encephalitis, confusion, delirium, irritability and aggression. During the later part of the early organ phase, patients may start to display clear hemorrhagic manifestations such as petechiae, mucosal bleeding, uncontrolled leakage from venipuncture sites, visceral hemorrhagic effusions, melena, bloody diarrhea, hematemesis and ecchymoses. During this phase, multiple organs are affected including the pancreas, liver and kidneys. The late organ phase is identified as lasting from day thirteen until day twenty+ in the course of illness. In this phase, the patient s condition develops into a critical state, which can include convulsions, severe metabolic disturbances, diffuse coagulopathy, multiorgan failure and shock. In this stage, severe dehydration reduces circulation, resulting in multiorgan dysfunction and anuria. Patients in the preagonal stage develop neurological symptoms including restlessness, obtundation, confusion, dementia or coma. Spontaneous abortion represents an additional complication in pregnant women. Fatalities typically occur between eight sixteen days after the onset of symptoms. Survivors do not normally display the most severe manifestations of disease and may not even reach the late organ phase. During the recovery and convalescent phase, those patients often suffer complications such as myalgia, arthralgia, asthenia, hepatitis, ocular disease and psychosis. Social separation is of particular concern.

		Pathology and pathophysiology Experimental animal models Disease modeling with laboratory animals is an effective strategy to study pathogenesis and host immunological responses. Indeed, as a result of our limited knowledge of MARV pathogenesis from clinical reports, information from laboratory animal experiments have played a significant role in our current understanding of MHF disease mechanisms.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		To date, four MARV disease models have been developed using immunocompetent animals; NHPs, hamsters, guinea pigs and mice. Of these models, NHPs are the gold standard. They are highly susceptible to MARV infections, with almost one hundred percent  lethality, and display hallmark pathological features similar to those seen in human infections. Furthermore, direct transmission of MARV between NHPs by intimate contact has been established.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		While MARV causes no apparent illness in immunocompetent rodents, adaptation of virus by serial passages has been used to establish lethal infection models for guinea pigs, mice and hamsters. These adapted viruses target the same primary cells and tissues that are infected in humans and NHPs. However, infection with adapted viruses in rodents, particularly mice, causes only moderate and inconsistent coagulation abnormalities and hemorrhagic manifestations. In addition, neuropathogenicity is a unique hallmark of infection in the hamster model. Despite the subtle differences in pathology compared with NHPs and humans, these rodent models remain both relevant and convenient, and have been used to study various aspects of pathogenicity and host immune responses, as well as to develop vaccines, antivirals and therapeutics.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Major target cells and organs Cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system, including macrophages, monocytes, Kupffer cells and dendritic cells, are all known to be primary target cells for filovirus infection. This is supported by immunohistochemical and electron microscopic examinations of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighty seven Kenyan case, which detected viral antigen and virions in both circulating and tissue associating macro phages, as well as flow cytometric analyses, which revealed MARV infection in macrophages of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell population of infected macaques. It has been proposed that MARV induced paralysis of the innate immune responses, required for induction of an antiviral state, contributes to systemic viral replication in vivo. Moreover, in vitro studies have demonstrated that uncontrolled activation of infected mononuclear phagocytic system cells triggers the aberrant induction and release of cytokines/chemokines, which subsequently may lead to increased vascular permeability and coagulation abnormalities. At the organ level, liver and lymphoid tissues are the main targets for MARV; however, nearly all organs present with pathological changes upon infection, such as focal or disseminated necrosis with a lack of significant inflammatory responses.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		In humans, MARV infection causes deleterious changes in the lymphoid tissues, including necrosis of the follicles and medulla of the lymph nodes and the red pulp of the spleen, as well as depletion of lymphocytes. Since MARV does not infect lymphocytes, bystander apoptosis has been proposed as the principle mechanism behind this phenomenon. Widespread proliferation of reticuloendothelial tissue in the spleen and lymph nodes, as well as degeneration and necrosis of lymphoid cells, are also observed in the hamster model, while the NHP model displays extensive necrosis in parenchymal cells and apoptosis of lymphocytes, similar to human infection.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Other targets include cells of the reticuloendothelial system, the adrenal gland and pancreatic islets, as well as fibroblast like cells and hepatocytes. In particular, studies on fatal human and NHP cases have emphasized the liver as a main target for MARV replication. In vitro studies have identified the asialoglycoprotein receptor as a liver specific receptor capable of enhancing MARV infection, an observation that may serve to explain the hepatotropic nature of the infection. Necrosis of the liver parenchyma is a common finding and causes extensive reticuloendothelial system destruction. Consequently, increases in liver enzymes such as aspartate amino transferase, alanine aminotransferase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase are characteristic of MARV infections. Since multiple clotting factors are synthesized in the liver, the pathological liver changes probably also contribute to the coagulation defects observed during MARV infection. Along with massive coagulation defects, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, the overall systemic virus replication and associated pathology probably trigger the multiorgan failures observed in severe/lethal MHF cases. In addition, adrenal cortical necrosis with impairment of steroid synthesizing enzyme production and secretion is probably the because of hypotension and hypovolemia, contributing to the development of shock.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Other organs Renal dysfunction presenting as proteinuria is frequently observed in MHF patients. Consistent with these observations, macroscopic findings show that kidneys of patients are pale, swollen and indicate grave parenchymal damage associated with signs of tubular insufficiency. Pathological findings in the lung and heart of patients have not been uniform; however, findings from individual patients suggest that MARV may also affect these organs. Scrotal pain is commonly reported in MHF patients, with a few cases of orchitis. In addition to these visceral effects, neurological consequences of MARV infection have been reported. In particular, clouded consciousness, occasionally associated with aggressiveness and symptoms of encephalitis, are common in MHF patients.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Hemorrhagic diatheses and coagulation abnormalities Marburg virus infection causes coagulation abnormalities, increased vascular permeability and hemorrhagic manifestations, all of which are closely inter related and result in the development of typical VHF manifestations. Coagulation abnormalities are observed as thrombocytopenia associated with prolonged coagulation times, reduced factor V and II levels and deficiency in fibrinogen. The limited clinical data available from outbreaks indicate that DIC might play a central role in the emergence of hemorrhagic manifestations, as indicated by the fibrin deposition reported from the autopsies of several fatal MHF cases.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		In patients, hemorrhages have been observed at both the macroscopic   levels. During the DRC outbreak, it was reported that bleeding signs were more frequently observed in fatal cases than in survivors, although these difference were not statistically significant. In NHPs, similar hemorrhagic syndromes, including bleeding from the mucosal membranes, petechial rash and DIC, are observed.

	Title: Differences in pathogenesis between MARV & ZEBOV infection Although EHF
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		and MHF exhibit very similar clinical pathology, some significant differences are apparent in the macaque model. The most obvious difference is their susceptibility to postexposure treatment with the tissue factor pathway inhibitor recombinant nematode anti coagulant protein ctwo. In the ZEBOV NHP model, an important role for TF in triggering hemorrhagic complications in macaques has recently been established. Consistent with this, treatment of ZEBOV infected macaques with rNAPctwo demonstrates considerable efficacy. However, rNAPctwo treatment of animals infected with MARV was significantly less effective, suggesting a less prominent involvement of the TF pathway in MARV pathogenesis. In addition, the Angolan strain of MARV is more hepatotropic than ZEBOV, resulting in nearly two log higher liver titers. This then suggests that the coagulation disorders observed in MARV infected animals may be more dependent on hepatocyte necrosis. These studies not only make clear the existence of key differences between the pathogenic processes in EHF and MHF but, since these pathways also influence responses to vaccination and postexposure treatment to these viruses, they also highlight the critical need for a better understanding of the different pathogenic mechanisms involved if we are to develop effective treatments for filoviral hemorrhagic fevers.

	Title: Immune responses to infection
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		There is very limited information available regarding the host immunological responses, either innate or acquired, to MARV infections. Based on knowledge from other VHFs, including EHF, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with uncontrolled release of pro and anti inflammatory cytokines and chemokines   and other soluble mediators is probably a key pathogenic element of MHF. To date, only a single NHP study has demonstrated expression of IFN and IL six in MARV infected animals. This finding is supported by in vitro studies, which also indicate that activation of monocytes/macrophages by MARV infection induces IL six, IL eight and TNF. TNF, in particular, was responsible for increased endothelial cell permeability, measured in a surrogate tissue culture system, suggesting that this mediator might be a key contributor to abnormal vascular permeability observed in vivo.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Hematological changes during infection include early leukopenia followed by pronounced leukocytosis beginning in the early organ phase of the disease. Neutrophilia and monocytosis were also observed with moderate eosinophilia. These hematological changes might contribute to immunosuppression in MHF patients, which can lead to secondary bacterial infections during the prolonged disease course and/or the recovery phase. Findings from ZEBOV infections suggest bystander cell death/apoptosis via the TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand and Fas death receptor signaling pathways occurs as a result of interaction between T lymphocytes and infected/activated monocytes/ macrophages during filovirus infection. In addition, similar to patients with severe sepsis, high levels of soluble nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines in the blood may serve as a trigger for intravascular apoptosis. On the other hand, a deduced retrovirus like immunosuppressive motif has also been identified in the filovirus glycoprotein, suggesting that the MARV glycoprotein might also play a role in lymphocyte dysfunction.

	Title: Diagnosis
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Filoviruses also possess the ability to evade the host type I interferon response. EBOV VPthree5 has been shown to function in blocking IFN production through inhibition of IRF three activation; however, this has not been directly demonstrated for MARV. Furthermore, while EBOV VP24 has recently been shown to have an additional role in inhibiting IFN signaling by blocking the nuclear import of phosphorylated STAT1, MARV VP24 lacks this activity. Instead, MARV VP40 functions by blocking both STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear accumulation.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		There is no detailed information available regarding acquired immune responses upon recovery from MHF. During the DRC outbreak, both IgM and IgG antibodies were detected among survivors between thirty one and one thousand, three hundred and seventy six days after disease onset, and during the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty seven outbreak, convalescent serum from patients was used for direct immunofluorescent based antigen detection assays, clearly indicating that MARV specific antibodies are produced.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		The control of MHF outbreaks relies on a combination of case identification, contact tracing and patient isolation, supported with laboratory diagnostics. Clinical diagnosis of MHF is difficult in the early phase of an outbreak because of the similarities in the clinical symptoms with many tropical infectious diseases, in particular malaria, rickettsial infections and typhoid fever. This often results in a critical delay in implementing infection control procedures and the initiation of patient management. Individual cases outside the epidemic area need more extensive diagnostic evaluation and careful consideration of the patient s travel history to confirm MHF.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Laboratory diagnostics consist of virological, serological and molecular methods. The most suitable and reliable specimen for diagnostics is blood but other specimens such as saliva, as well as breast milk, can serve as alternative specimen sources if blood is not available. First line diagnostics for MHF rely primarily on the detection of viral genome by reverse transcription PCR   methods or viral antigen by ELISA technology. Detection of the host immune response is achieved mainly using antibody detection ELISA. Virus isolation and electron microscopy serve as confirmatory options with the restriction that they can only be performed at certain specialized locations having the necessary facilities.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		To date, conventional RT PCR, quantitative real time RT PCR and reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification methods have been developed for the detection of MARV RNA in clinical specimens. These techniques are high throughput and rapid. They also display high sensitivity and specificity and are widely applied primary choices for MARV diagnosis. In addition, the chaotropic agent guanidinium isothiocyanate, a major component of most commercial RNA extraction buffers, has been proven to render the diagnostic samples noninfectious, allowing safe handling of clinical material. Furthermore, pan MARV or pan filovirus RT PCR assays that amplify all known MARV strains or even all known filovirus species using consensus PCR primer sets have been developed for rapid diagnostic screening. These broadly cross specific primer sets will potentially provide an increased ability to detect a wide array of filoviruses, which would aid not only in patient identification and early outbreak control, but also in epidemiological and epizoological investigations. Currently, RT PCR and quantitative real time RT PCR are utilized as the standard for molecular diagnosis in the field. In the future, however, the reverse transcription loop mediated isothermal amplification method may replace these assays owing to its simplicity and lower costs.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		The main alternative and confirmatory assay for acute MHF diagnostics is the antigen detection ELISAs. These assays use either hyperimmune serum or virus protein specific antibodies to capture MARV antigen. Direct IgM and IgG ELISAs, as well as IgM capture ELISAs, are commonly used for the detection of virus specific antibodies. MARV specific IgM antibodies can appear as early as two days postonset of symptoms and disappear from thirty to one hundred and sixty eight days after infection, while IgG antibodies can persist for many years. Accordingly, IgM capture ELISAs are more frequently used for the diagnosis of acute illness, while IgG ELISAs are primarily used to identify individuals who have recovered from MHF infection or for conducting epidemio logical and epizoological studies. The more recently developed ELISAs use recombinantly expressed viral proteins rather than infected cell lysates as antigens for the detection of virus specific antibodies.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		In addition to these highly specific tests for MARV diagnostics, broad clinical syndrome based technologies have been developed on the basis of multiplex PCR and pan microbial oligonucleotide array technologies. These assays; however, have yet to be implemented into common diagnostic settings.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Prophylaxis and postexposure treatment of MHF Since there is no specific therapy for MARV available, treatment currently involves palliative management of symptoms, including pain management and supportive care measures, such as maintenance of blood volume and electrolyte balance. While it remains unclear to what extent this kind of supportive therapy improves patient outcome, it must be noted that patients treated in countries with the infrastructure to provide a high standard of intensive care have much lower case fatality rates than those reported during the recent outbreaks in Angola and DRC.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Over the years, different, mainly unspecific, treatment approaches have been applied in MHF patients. In addition, several experimental approaches have also been evaluated in animal models. Table two summarizes and discusses the outcomes of those attempts. During the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty seven MARV outbreak, patients were treated with various antibiotics, antipyretics and clotting factor concentrates, mainly to reduce fever, prevent and treat secondary infections and counteract coagulation disorders, respectively. This approach still forms a part of any intensive care regime today. In addition, convalescent serum transfer was applied in a few secondary cases during the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty seven outbreak and extracorporeal hemosorbent and hemodialysis therapy was applied in a Russian case resulting from laboratory exposure. Despite positive outcomes in these cases, the actual value of these treatment approaches is questionable owing to the low number of cases. In addition, those treated by passive transfer of convalescent plasma were secondary cases, which are generally less severe regardless of treatment.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Experimental approaches evaluated in the various animal models for MHF have mostly targeted either the virus or host responses. Ribavirin, a broad spectrum synthetic guanosine analog, with virustatic activity against a number of DNA and RNA viruses, and IFN have demonstrated no beneficial effect on MARV infection. The value of passive antibody therapy using either convalescent serum or monoclonal antibodies has been revisited over the years. While the initial success in the one thousand, nine hundred and sixty seven outbreak was questionable and, more recently, researchers have demonstrated efficacy of NHP derived convales cent serum in a passive transfer experiment using the NHP model. Monoclonal antibodies targeting glycoprotein or VP40 have also shown efficacy in the guinea pig model. Among the most promising approaches currently being investigated is the use of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers inhibiting viral protein expression, which has also shown efficacy in the NHP model. The other promising approach is postexposure treatment with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus based vaccine expressing MARV glycoprotein. This approach has demonstrated efficacy in NHPs when administered once up to forty eight h postinfection. While the mechanism of this vaccine in post exposure treatment remains unknown, it is most likely related to viral interference and/or the induction a strong innate immune response.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Some therapeutic success has also been reported by targeting deleterious host responses; however, most of these approaches have not yet been evaluated in NHP models. Neutralizing antibodies against TNF have demonstrated efficacy in the guinea pig model only when administered three days postinfection, but not if administered earlier in infection, perhaps indicating that TNF plays a beneficial role for the early host immune response. Guinea pigs were also protected by treatment with Desferal, an IL one and TNF antagonist, and partially protected by treatment with an IL one receptor antagonist. More recently, moderate effects have been achieved in NHPs using treatment with the TF/factor VIIa inhibitor rNAPc2. The effect was reduced compared with previous promising data in the EBOV NHP model, and may suggest a less prominent involvement of the TF pathway in MARV pathogenesis. However, since challenge in this study was performed with the seemingly more virulent Angola strain, the outcome may also be more promising with other MARV strains.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Early attempts at vaccine development against MARV used formalin inactivated virus and demon strated partial protection in both the guinea pig and NHP models. However, given the inherent safety concerns with this approach, efforts to further develop this platform have ceased. DNA vaccination approaches based on plasmids expressing MARV glycoprotein and/or nucleoprotein require multiple vaccinations to achieve protection from lethal outcome, but not disease development, suggesting that this approach alone is also not ideal. More recently, many of the attempts to develop a vaccine have focused on the use of various live attenuated and replication defective   vectors, with significant successes in the NHP model. Those vaccination approaches that have been shown to be protective in NHPs are summarized in Table three At present, the most promising approaches are the recombinant Ad5 and VSV based vectors expressing the Musoke strain glycoprotein. Both of these platforms have shown protective/cross protective efficacy after a single immunization in the NHP model against challenge with all known MARV strains, even the genetically divergent Ravn strain and the more virulent Angola strain. Equally promising is vaccination based on the use of virus like particles, which physically resemble authentic MARV particles but are only composed of glycoprotein, nucleoprotein and VP40, and are thus nonreplicating and noninfectious. VLP vaccination works best in combination with an adjuvant and showed protective efficacy in NHPs against challenge with a range of MARV strains. Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages. The VSV vectors are attenuated but replication competent, thus their safety remains the major concern. The Ad5 vectors are replication incompetent but pre existing immunity in the human population is expected to reduce their efficacy, and while the VLP platform is seemingly the safest approach, large scale production and multiple administrations remain issues.

	Title: Conclusion
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Recent outbreaks have shown that MARV is capable of causing much more serious outbreaks than once thought. These large outbreaks not only had unprecedentedly high case fatality rates but also demonstrated that MARV affects a much larger geographical region than was previously appreciated. This, together with two recently imported MHF cases into Europe and the USA, emphasizes the potential role of MARV as a serious public health threat, not just in Africa, and makes clear the need to better understand the pathogenesis of MARV and develop therapeutic and/or prophylactic interventions. At present, much of our current appreciation of MARV pathogenesis is based on early case reports together with comparisons to EBOV. However, research in this area has begun to identify an increasing number of differences between EBOV and MARV in terms of their pathogenesis, both at the clinical and molecular levels. This highlights the need for more research into MARV infection and MHF specifically, as well as a need for greater appreciation of MHF as a distinct clinical entity. Certainly, our ability to manage future MHF outbreaks as well as imported cases or laboratory acquired infections would be vastly enhanced by the availability of vaccines and therapeutic options. While this area of research has seen tremendous progress in recent years, these efforts must be maintained and targeted towards product development and licensure.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Future perspective While research efforts have led to significant advances in recent years, particularly with respect to our understanding of MARV ecology and the development of treatment and vaccination options, much remains to be done. In particular, there are surprisingly few data regarding MARV pathogenesis in either humans or animal models, with the limited studies indicating differences between MARV and EBOV biology and pathogenesis. In addition, the occurrence of larger outbreaks in recent years suggests that MARV should be considered a much greater public health threat in the future than it is currently. This highlights the need for the development of quick and reliable diagnostic methods that can be applied both in laboratory and field settings, more careful clinical investigations during future MHF outbreaks in order to better understand pathogenesis in humans and intensified efforts to develop new therapies and vaccines, as well as pushing current promising products through the regulatory licensing process.

		comparable with Zaire ebolavirus. The reasons for this remain unclear. Isolation of MARV from bats species has suggested that these function as a reservoir. Comprehensive studies combining epidemiological data and ecological surveys will be needed to predict future outbreaks. Clinical signs and disease progression Marburg hemorrhagic fever starts as a nonspecific febrile illness but rapidly progresses to include hemorrhagic complications and, in the most severe cases, a septic shock-like syndrome. Death is due to multiorgan failure and shock. Survivors undergo a protracted recovery associated with a variety of complications. Pathology and pathophysiology Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system represent the primary target cells for MARV infection. Immunosuppression is partially due to lymphocyte apoptosis, probably as a result of bystander apoptosis. Uncontrolled cytokine production by infected macrophages is a probable source of vascular damage/leakage during infection. .

		. Marburg hemorrhagic fever pathogenesis model Primary targets cells for Marburg virus infection are macrophages and dendritic cells. In dendritic cells, infection leads to paralysis of the innate response and dysregulation of costimulation of lymphocytes. Macrophage infection leads to the production of proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-, which may induce bystander apoptosis in lymphocyte populations, thereby contributing to lymphopenia and immunosuppression. Together with IL-six macrophage-derived TNF-also induces changes in vascular permeability. In addition, the production of TF by infected macrophages leads to dysregulation of coagulation, which is further reinforced by hepatocyte infection, leading to decreased synthesis of liver-derived clotting factors. Infection of adrenal cortical cells results in hypotension and metabolic disorders, which together with immunosuppression and coagulopathy contribute to multiorgan failure and shock.
