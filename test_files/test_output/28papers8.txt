		| Efficacy of individual and combined monoclonal antibody treatments in guinea pigs and nonhuman primates Treatment groups, time of treatment Dose P value, compared with cZMAb MB-three Guinea pigs two two Nonhuman primates. Survival and weight loss were monitored over twenty eight days. Treatment with conethreeCsix or honethreeFsix yielded seventeen percent  survival with a mean time to death of eight point four six one point seven and ten point two six one point eight days, respectively. The average weight loss for conethreeCsix or honethreeFsix-treated animals was nine percent  and twenty one percent. In nonhuman primates, animals were given three doses of mAb conethreeCsix, honethreeFsix or csixD8, beginning at twenty four h after challenge with the Kikwit variant of EBOV eighteen and survival was monitored over twenty eight days. Only conethreeCsix treatment yielded any survivors, with one of three animals protected from EBOV challenge, confirming in two separate animal models that conethreeCsix is the component that provides the highest level of protection in the MB-three cocktail. We then tested mAb conethreeCsix in combination with two of three mAbs from ZMAb in guinea pigs. The individual antibodies composing ZMAb were originally chosen for protection studies based on their in vivo protection of guinea pigs against EBOV-M-GPAonenine, and all three possible combinations were tested: ZMappone, ZMapptwo, and compared to the originator cocktails ZMAb and MB-three.

		Platelets per mmthree in addition to a drastic drop in body temperature shortly before death. At the time of death, animal Bthree had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, total bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, in addition to decreased levels of glucose, suggesting multiple organ failure. All six Group B animals showed fever in addition to viraemia at three dpi by TCID50 and RT qPCR. It was interesting to note that in Bthree, the viraemia reached approximately one hundred and six TCID50 after three dpi, suggesting that this NHP was particularly susceptible to EBOV infection. No escape mutants were detected with this animal. The administration of ZMapptwo at the reported concentrations was unable to effectively control viraemia at this level. Virus shedding was also detected from the oral and rectal swabs by RT qPCR in the moribund NHP Bthree. Since ZMapp1 demonstrated superior protection to ZMapptwo in this survival study, ZMapp1 was carried forward to test the limits of protection conferred by this mAb cocktail in a subsequent investigation. ZMapp-treated NHPs In this experiment, rhesus macaques were assigned into three treatment groups of six and a control group of three animals, with all treatment NHPs receiving three doses of ZMapp, and total bilirubin indicate significant liver damage, a hallmark of filovirus infections. However, ZMapp was successful in reversing observed disease symptoms and physiological abnormalities after twelve dpi, two days after the last ZMapp administration. Furthermore, ZMapp treatment was able to lower the high virus loads observed in animals Ftwo and F5 (up to one hundred and six TCID50 ml undetectable levels by fourteen dpi. ZMapp cross-reacts with Guinea EBOV Although the results were very promising with EBOV-K-infected NHPs, it was unknown whether therapy with ZMapp would be similarly effective against the Guinean variant of EBOV, the virus responsible for the West African outbreak. Direct comparison of published amino acid sequences between EBOV-G and EBOV-K showed that the epitopes targeted by ZMapptwo0,two1 were not mutated between the two virus variants, indicating that the antibodies should retain their specificity for the viral glycoprotein. To confirm this, in vitro assays were carried out to compare the binding affinity of c1threeC6, ctwoG4 and c4G7 to sucrosepurified EBOV-G and EBOV-K. As measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the ZMapp components showed slightly better binding kinetics for EBOV-G than for EBOV-K. Additionally, the neutralizing activity of individual mAbs was evaluated in the absence of complement for ctwoG4 and c4G7, and in the presence of complement for c1threeC6, as they have previously been shown to neutralize EBOV only under these conditions1three. The results supported the ELISA binding data, with comparable neutralizing activities between the two viruses.

		The West African outbreak of two thousand and fourteen has highlighted the troubling absence of available vaccine or therapeutic options to save thousands of lives and stop the spread of EBOV. The lack of a clinically acceptable treatment offers limited incentive for people who suspect they might be infected to report themselves for medical help. Several previous studies have showed that antibodies are crucial for host survival from EBOVtwotwo twenty four Prior NHP studies have also demonstrated that the ZMAb cocktail could protect one hundred percent  or fifty percent  of animals when dosing was initiated one or two dpi, while the MB-three cocktail protected sixty seven percent  of animals with the same dosing regimen. Before the success with monoclonal-antibody-based therapies, other candidate therapeutics had only demonstrated efficacy when given within sixty min of EBOV exposure. Our results with ZMapp, a cocktail comprising of individual monoclonal antibodies selected from MB-three and ZMAb, demonstrate for the first time the successful protection of NHPs from EBOV disease when intervention was initiated as late as five dpi. In the preceding ZMappone/ ZMapptwo experiment, eleven out of twelve treated animals had detectable fever, and live virus could be detected in the blood of eleven out of twelve animals by three dpi. Therefore, for the majority of these animals, treatment was therapeutic   bode well for treating EBOV-G infections with ZMapp. Since the host antibody response is known to correlate with and is required for protection from EBOV infectionstwothree,twenty four monoclonal-antibodybased treatments are likely to form the centrepiece of any future therapeutic strategies for fighting EBOV outbreaks. However, whether ZMapp-treated survivors can be susceptible to re-infection is unknown. In a previous study of murine ZMAb-treated, EBOV-challenged NHP survivors, a rechallenge of these animals with the same virus at ten and thirteen weeks after initial challenge yielded six of six survivors and four of six survivors, respectivelytwo7. While specific CDfour one and CD8 one T-cell responses could be detected in all animals, the circulating levels of glycoprotein -specific IgG were shown to be tenfold lower in non-survivors compared to survivors, suggesting that antibody levels may be indicative of protective immunitytwo7. Sustained immunity with experimental EBOV vaccines in NHPs remains unknown; however, in a recent study, a decrease in GP-specific IgG levels due to old age or a suboptimal reaction to the VSVDG/EBOVGP vaccine in rodents also seem to be indicative of non-survivaltwo8. ZMapp consists of a cocktail of highly purified monoclonal antibodies; which constitutes a less controversial alternative than whole-blood transfusions from convalescent survivors, as was performed during the one thousand, nine hundred and ninety five EBOV outbreak in Kikwittwo9. The safety of monoclonal antibody therapy is well documented, with generally low rates of adverse reactions, the capacity to confer rapid and specific immunity in all populations, including the young, the elderly and the immunocompromised, and if necessary, the ability to provide higher-than-natural levels of immunity compared to vaccinationsthree0. The evidence presented here suggests that ZMapp offers the best option of the experimental therapeutics currently in development for treating EBOV-infected patients. We hope that initial safety testing in humans will be undertaken soon, preferably within the next few months, to enable the compassionate use of ZMapp as soon as possible.
