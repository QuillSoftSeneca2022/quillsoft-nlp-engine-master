		Global pandemics with high mortality and morbidity occur when a virulent new viral strain emerges, against which the human population has no immunity. The influenza A virus was responsible for three global pandemics in the past century: Spanish flu in one thousand, nine hundred and eighteen Asian flu in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty seven and Hong Kong flu in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty eight   Influenza virus outbreaks occur with regularity, but their severity varies. Swine Influenza is a respiratory disease common among pigs caused by type A influenza, principally subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H2N1, HthreeN1, HthreeN2, and H2Nthree. fifty six The influenza virus belongs to the, which consists of influenza A, B, and C viruses7 and has an envelope, is single-stranded, negatively sensed RNA, eight separate segments, and pleomorphic appearance with an average diameter of one hundred and twenty nm.7-ten

		The novel H1N1 strain, which is responsible for the current global pandemic of swine origin influenza, was first recognized at the border between Mexico and United States in April two thousand and nine During a short span of two months, it became the first pandemic of the two1st century. Before this time, the same triple reassorted virus was isolated in swine as early as one thousand, nine hundred and ninety eight with sporadic infections in humans as well. one thousand, two hundred and thirteen The pandemic influenza A H1N1 two thousand and ninevirus caused the first pandemic influenza of the new millennium, and has affected more than two hundred and fourteen countries and caused more than eighteen thousand, four hundred and forty nine deaths. It is estimated that the influenza pandemic that started with the one thousand, nine hundred and eighteen Spanish flu killed twenty to fifty million people worldwide, followed by epidemics of Asian flu in one thousand, nine hundred and fifty seven Hong Kong flu in one thousand, nine hundred and sixty eight and Russian flu in one thousand, nine hundred and seventy seven each with random and severe attacks on human populations. The H1N1 form of swine flu is a descendent of the strain that caused the one thousand, nine hundred and eighteen flu pandemic. As well as persisting in pigs, the descendants of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighteen virus also circulated in humans throughout the twentyth century, contributing to the normal seasonal epidemics of influenza. The first identification of an influenza virus as a because of disease in pigs occurred in one thousand, nine hundred and thirty For the next sixty years, swine influenza strains were almost exclusively H1N1. Then, between one thousand, nine hundred and ninety seven and two thousand and two new strains of three different subtypes and five different genotypes emerged as causes of influenza among pigs in North America. On August thirteen two thousand and nine the World Health Organization reported that one hundred and eighty two thousand, one hundred and sixty six laboratories confirmed cases of influenza A/H1N1, with one thousand, seven hundred and ninety nine deaths in one hundred and seventy eight countries. In two thousand and fifteen the incidence of swine flu increased substantially to reach five-year highs with more than ten thousand cases and seven hundred and seventy four deaths reported.

	Title: CLINICAL FEATUR ES
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Important clinical features of swine influenza include fever and upper respiratory symptoms such as cough, runny nose, and sore throat. Headache, body aches, fatigue, diarrhea, and vomiting also have been observed. There is insufficient information to date about clinical complications of the current pandemic influenza A virus infection. Clinicians should expect complications to be similar to seasonal influenza: sinusitis, otitis media, croup, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, status asthmaticus, myocarditis, pericarditis, myositis, rhabdomyolysis, encephalitis, seizures, toxic shock syndrome, and secondary bacterial pneumonia with or without sepsis.2,16 Individuals at extremes of age and with pre-existing medical conditions are at higher risk for complications and exacerbation of the underlying conditions.16,17

	Title: DIAGNOSTIC TESTS
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Routine investigations required for evaluation and management of a patient with the symptoms just described are required. These may include hematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological tests as necessary. A diagnosis of confirmed swine flu requires laboratory testing of a respiratory sample. Tests used to detect influenza virus infections in humans can include reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, virus isolation, and assays to detect a four-fold rise detect influenza virus antigens.   Nucleotide Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis. Amplicons for gene sequencing were generated by reverse transcription, followed by PCR amplification to generate overlapping doublestranded DNA amplicons covering each of eight segments of the influenza virus genome.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Phylogenetic Analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of sequences contained six gene segments   are to be obtained. The sample should be collected by a trained physician or microbiologist preferably before administration of the antiviral drug. Specimens should be kept at four!C in viral transport media until transported for testing. The samples should be transported to designated laboratories with in twenty four hours. If they cannot be transported then they MUST be stored at seventy!C. Paired blood samples at an interval of fourteen days for serological testing should also be collected.31,32

		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		The guiding principles of treatment are as follows:
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		d Early implementation of infection control precautions to minimize household spread of disease. d Prompt treatment to prevent severe illness and death. d Early identification and follow-up of individuals at risk.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		The following infrastructure, manpower, and material support are needed: d Isolation facilities: If a dedicated isolation room is not available, patients can be cohorted in a well-ventilated isolation ward with beds kept one m apart. d Manpower: dedicated doctors, nurses, and paramedics. d Equipment: portable x-ray machine, ventilators, large oxygen cylinders, pulse oximeter. d Supplies: adequate quantities of personal protective equipment, disinfectants, and medications zero point three Standard operating procedures include the following:
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		d Standard infection control precautions should be reinforced  dare used to treat some cases of influenza, although some of these drugs are not licensed in all countries.33-thirty seven Both groups of drugs are effective against some influenza A viruses, although they may have some side effects. Antiviral drugs are most effective if they are started within the first forty eight hours after the clinical signs begin, although they also may be used in severe or high-risk cases first seen after this time.33,3five Antiviral resistance can develop rapidly and may emerge during treatment. thirty three million, three hundred and forty three thousand, eight hundred and thirty nine One recent study reported resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors in nine percent  of swine influenza viruses that contained the Ntwo neuraminidase .3nine Zanamivir and oseltamivir are members of a new class of drugs called neuraminidase inhibitors and are active against both influenza types A and B. Zanamivir is provided as a dry powder that is administered by inhalation. It is approved for treatment of uncomplicated acute influenza A or B in patients aged seven years and older who have been symptomatic for less than forty eight hours. Oseltamivir is provided as an oral capsule. It is approved for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza A or B in individuals at least one year of age who have been symptomatic for less than forty eight hours. Zanamivir is approved for prophylaxis of influenza in patients five years and older. Oseltamivir is approved for prophylaxis of influenza infection in individuals no younger than one year of age. In two00sevenetwo thousand and eight a significant increase in the prevalence of oseltamivir resistance was reported among influenza A viruses worldwide. During the two00sevenetwo008 influenza seasons, ten point nine percent  of HoneNone viruses tested in the United States were resistant to oseltamivir. During two thousand and eight more than ninety percent  of HoneNone viruses were resistant to oseltamivir. During the two008etwo00nine influenza seasons, the CDC recommended that individuals who tested positive for influenza A receive only zanamivir if treatment was indicated. Oseltamivir should be used alone only if recent local surveillance data indicate that circulating viruses are likely to be influenza A or influenza B viruses, which have not been found to be resistant to oseltamivir. Antiviral agents for influenza are an adjunct to vaccine and are not a substitute for vaccine. Vaccination remains the principal means for preventing influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Presently, the government of India recommends Tamiflu as a drug of choice. Tamiflu is available at all government health offices. Human influenza A is susceptible to both oseltamivir and zanamivir, two antiviral medications approved for the prevention and treatment of influenza in the United States. Oseltamivir is the recommended drug both for prophylaxis and treatment.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		In the current phase, if a person conforms to the case definition of suspect case, he or she would be provided oseltamivir. four thousand and forty three Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated. Gastrointestinal side effects. Suspected cases not having pneumonia do not require antibiotic therapy. Antibacterial agents should be administered, if required, as per locally accepted clinical practice guidelines. Patients on mechanical ventilation should be given antibiotics prophylactically to prevent hospital-associated infections.

		It has been observed that some patients, despite being asymptomatic, continue to test positive for influenza A H1N1. A patient who has been treated and has recovered, despitetesting positive, has very little possibility of infecting others. In view of this, the following recommendations have been made46: d Patients who responded to treatment after two or three days and who become totally asymptomatic should be discharged after five days of treatment. There is no need for a repeat test.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		d Patients who continue to have symptoms of fever, sore throat, etc., even on day five should continue treatment for an additional five days. If these patients become asymptomatic during the course of treatment, there is no need to test further. d For patients who continue to be symptomatic even after ten days of treatment or for those individuals with respiratory distress and in whom secondary infection is taken care of, and if patients continue to she would virus, then these individuals should be tested for resistance to antiviral. The dose of antiviral may be adjusted on case-by-case basis. The family of patients discharged earlier should be educated about personal hygiene and infection control measures at home; children should not attend school during this period.

		The treating physicians and other paramedical personnel at the isolation facility are considered at high risk and should be put on chemoprophylaxis. Chemoprophylaxis is advised for those contacts at high risk. In phase five if the clusters are reported for the first time, and given that those exposed are known and can be traced easily, then family, social, and community contacts should be given chemoprophylaxis. Mass Chemoprophylaxis. The strategy of containment by geography, an approach that includes giving oseltamivir to every individual in a prescribed geographic limit of five km from the epicenter, would be applied for the following reasons: d If the virus is lethal and causing severe morbidity and high mortality. d Although affecting humans, the virus is not efficiently transmitting in the population. d If the cluster is limited by natural geographic boundaries. d All close contacts of suspected, probable, and confirmed cases. Close contacts include household and social contacts, family members, workplace or school contacts, fellow travelers, and so on. d All health care personnel coming in contact with suspected, probable, or confirmed cases.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Oseltamivir is the drug of choice and prophylaxis should be provided until ten days after the individual s last exposure.

		Close contacts of suspected, probable, and confirmed cases should be advised to remain at home for at least seven days after the last contact with the case. Monitoring of fever should be done for at least seven days. Prompt testing and hospitalization are required when symptoms are reported. All suspected cases and clusters of influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory infection cases need to be reported to the state health authorities and the Ministry of Once the patient is admitted to the hospital, the interior and exterior of the ambulance and any reusable patient care equipment must be sanitized using sodium hypochlorite/quaternary ammonium compounds. Recommended procedures for disposal of waste generated in the ambulance while transporting the patient should be followed.48,forty nine During the hospital stay, the patient should be admitted directly to the isolation facility and continue to wear the surgical mask. The identified medical, nursing, and paramedical personnel attending the patient should wear a full complement of PPE. If splashing with blood or other body fluids is anticipated, a waterproof apron should be worn over the PPE. Aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubation, nebulized medication administration, induction and aspiration of sputum or other respiratory secretions, airway suction, chest physiotherapy, and positive pressure ventilation should be performed by the treating physician or nurse, who should be wearing full complement of PPE with an Nninety five respirator.48, forty nine Sample collection and packing should be done under full cover of PPE with N-ninety five respirator. Hand hygiene must be performed before and after patient contact and after contact with contaminated items, whether or not gloves are worn. Until further evidence is available, infection control precautions should continue in an adult patient for seven days after resolution of symptoms and fourteen days after resolution of symptoms for children younger than twelve years because of longer period of viral shedding expected in children. The patient can return home, after resolution of fever, provided the he or she and household members follow recommended infection control measures and community health workers are available to monitor the patient. Because the virus can survive in the environment and disinfection or sterilization of reusable patient care equipment should be followed. All waste generated from influenza patients in isolation should be considered clinical infectious waste and should be treated and disposed of in accordance with national regulations pertaining to such waste. When transporting waste outside the isolation area, gloves should be used, followed by hand hygiene.48,forty nine Standard Operating Procedures on Use of PPE. PPE reduces the risk for infection when used correctly. PPE includes nonsterile gloves; a high-efficiency mask or three-layer surgical mask; longsleeved, cuffed gown; protective eyewear   for waste management.46,48,forty nine

	Title: DISCUSSION
	Sequence: 
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Sequence analysis of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighteen Spanish influenza virus genes have not revealed any obvious features that could account for its high virulence thus far.
		/-----------------------Paragraph-----------------------------/
		Analyses of the surface proteins of the one thousand, nine hundred and eighteen pandemic strain, however, suggest that this strain may have had a different origin. The hemagglutinin gene segment of the virus may have come directly from an avian source different from those currently circulating. Alternatively, the virus, or some of its gene segments, may have evolved in an intermediate host before emerging as a human pathogen. Determining whether pandemic influenza virus strains can emerge via different pathways will affect the scope and focus of surveillance and prevention efforts. The key prevention strategy for reducing influenza pandemiceassociated morbidity and mortality will be the implementation of inactivated influenza virus vaccines effective against the pandemic strain. Zanamivir and oseltamivir block influenza neuraminidase and prevent the cleavage of sialic acid residues, thus interfering with progeny virus dispersal within the mucosal secretions and reducing viral infectivity. Current surveillance efforts focused on rapid identification of novel strains in humans as well as efforts to minimize the possibility of cross-infection between species are aimed at detecting and preventing a new pandemic.
