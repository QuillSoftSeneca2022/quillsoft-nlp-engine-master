ABSTRACT
 

Background: Human influenza virus was recognized as a pandemic in 2009 by 
the World Health Organization. Since then many newer incidences was 
recognized in India, but there was no sufficient data from all state of India. This 
study will provide data from the Chhattisgarh state of India. 
Methods: It was a retrospective observational study from December 2015 to 
November 2017. All patient samples with suspected influenza infection were 
collected and analysed by Real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR
). 
Results: 341 patients' sample was collected and analysed; among these samples, 
07.9% of patients have all three serotype of influenza positive. Raipur district has 
the highest incidence of influenza A followed by Durg and Raigarh district of 
Chhattisgarh. There was no significant difference between male and female who 
was affected by the influenza virus. 
Conclusions: The incidence of Human influenza virus is lesser in Chhattisgarh 
as compare to the average states of India and the state capital has a higher rate of 
sample collection as well as positive influenza infection.

INTRODUCTION
 

Human influenza virus is a pig transmitted infectious 
disease and it is appeared to be highest mortality causing 
disease since past decade. In 2009, it was recognized as 
pandemic infectious disease by World health Organization, which was transmitted via human to human by 
aerosol. Influenza was first time recognized as Spanish flu 
in 1918-1919, which was also pandemic in nature. Illness 
oftenly present in farmers who had swine in their farms 
and that was observed by veterinarian J. S. Koen. The 
isolation of pig derived H1N1 virus was first time obtained 
during 1930 by Shope and Lewis then in 1974 human 

derived H1N1 virus was isolated, which confirm the 
hypothesis that pig derived H1N1 virus could infect human 
too. 

 

Human influenza or H1N1 influenza or Swine flu is a 
respiratory tract disorder comprised of flu like symptoms 
which include sore throat, rhinorrhoea, fever, chills, 
vomiting, restlessness, anorexia, headache, arthralgia and 
diarrhea. In patients with immune deficit, the clinical 
presentation of swine flu could be worsen and may lead to 
altered sensorium and respiratory collapse. Till date five 
serotype of H1N1 influenza was isolated which are H1N1, 
H1N2, H2N3, H3N1, and H3N2. Among these only H1N1 
causes human infection and rest are seen only in pigs.

Swine flu is an orthomyxo RNA virus, having two surface 
antigens   and N1 (Neuraminidase 
type 1).1 

 

In India, 27,236 laboratory confirmed cases with 981 
deaths were reported during 2009.4,5 The post pandemic 
period   62,000 laboratory confirmed swine flu 
with 5000 deaths was reported by the Ministry of Health 
and Family Welfare and also stated that the incidence was 
high during monsoon   and low during 
winter  .4-8 The incidences of H1N1 
influenza were keep rising worldwide. In India there was 
lack in sufficient data of human influenza virus infection 
from the many states. This study will provide the newly 
laboratory diagnosed cases of human influenza virus 
infection in the state of Chhattisgarh. 

 

METHODS 

 

It was hospital-based retrospective descriptive, recordbased 
analysis from December 2015 to November 2017. 
This study was carried out in the Department of 
Pharmacology, 
Late 
BRKM 
Government 
Medical 

College, Dimrapal, Jagdalpur, Chhattisgarh. Patients with 
the sign and symptoms of influenza viral infection who are 
falling under category B and C and Confirm case (tested 
positive for influenza infection) by real-time reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction   were 
included in this study. 

 

Patients from category B and C were administered proper 
therapy for influenza viral infection and samples were sent 
for confirmation, if the sample was negative, treatment 
was 
discontinued. 
The 
data 
related 
to 
patients' 

demographics from the H1N1 visiting screening centers, 
swine flu outpatient departments and swine flu isolation 
wards and hospitals from Chhattisgarh were collected. 
Testing of influenza virus was carried out at microbiology 
department of Late BRKM Government Medical College, 
Dimrapal, Jagdalpur. 

 

Collection of samples and confirmation 

 

Throat or nasal swab samples of suspected cases with 
influenza-like sign and symptoms were collected in Viral 
Transport Medium and sent to laboratories maintaining 
cold-chain. RNA was extracted by Purelink Viral 
RNA/DNA blood Mini Kit. RNA of 
each isolate was tested by separate primer/probe sets for 
InfA, H1N1 and H1 subtype as per the CDC real-time RTPCR 
protocol (ABI Step One Plus RT-PCR instrumentApplied 
Biosystems, USA).10 All the data related to 
demographic characteristics, was analysed using Epi Info 
v7.2 and Yates corrected chi-square   test. P-value 
<0.05 was considered statistically significant. 

 

RESULTS 

 

Total 341 samples were collected from different hospitals 
and medical colleges in the state with suspected H1N1 

infection. Out of total 341 sample, 54% patients were male 
and the mean age was 30.39 19.2, years-wise 
comparison depicted in Table 1. Trends of suspected cases 
of influenza infection between both the gender, higher 
percentage among female 31 to 40 were observed between 
21 to 30 year of age and in males at 0-10 years were the 
highest. Between Dec 2015 to Nov 2017, only 
7.9% patients were found to be positive of all three 
subtypes of human influenza stain like H1N1, Influenza-A 
and H1-subtype, while 46.3%   patients was found 
positive for influenza-A, 17.3%   for H1N1, 24.9% 
  for H1 subtype infection by RT PCR and all three 
was positive in 7.9%. Populated region of 
Chhattisgarh has higher rate of suspected cases such as 
Raipur, and Durg, even the most 
Trible region of Chhattisgarh   has comparable 
higher rate than other district. Maximum number of 
sample was send from the Raipur district followed by Durg 
and Raigarh.

Raipur has significant number of positive cases of 
influenza A, H1N1 and H1 subtype than other district of 
Chhattisgarh state. There was slightly higher 
incidence of Influenza A, H1N1, and H1 subtype observed 
in male patients than female. The mean percentage of 
Influenza- The positive test for influenza A, H1N1, and H1 

subtype was high in males than female patients. A was 
positive in male patient was 51.3% as compare to female 
patient was 48.7%, while 52.5% male patients 
were positive for H1N1 as compare to 47.5% female 
patients and H1 subtype was positive in 50.6% male 
patient vs. 49.4% in female patients. 

 

DISCUSSION 

 

The incidence of human influenza viral infection in 
Chhattisgarh is comparable from other state of India. The 
collections of sample were higher during rainy season as 
reported in national health profile of India. From 
December 2015 to November 2017, a total number of 341 
samples were sent to our center, out of which, highest 
number of sample   was received from Raipur district 
followed by Durg   district, which was comparable with the incidence of 
human influenza infection in the district of Rajasthan. 

Among these samples 07.9% was seropositive for all three 
subtypes of influenza virus such as Influenza-A, H1N1, 
and H1 Subtype. 

 

The incidence of Influenza-A was 46.3%, H1N1, 
and H1 subtype was 24.9%   from Dec-2015-2017. Among higher reporting districts of 
Chhattisgarh, the overall newer case of from Raipur was 
41.8%   and Baster 
  for Influenza-A subtype. Similarly, H1N1 is also 
most common seen in Raipur   followed by Raigarh 
  and, H1 Subtype incidences 
were also high in Raipur   
followed by Durg. These results 
signify the higher rate of incidence commonly seen in the 
state capital as also observed by Malhotra et al. The mean 
age of male patients those samples was obtained was 
30.39 19.2 years as compare to female patients was 
30.77 18.8. In female, common age group 
presenting Influenza like symptoms was 21-30 years, while the common age group in male patients was 
31-40 years, age-wise distribution is shown in the 
table-1, and similar distribution was also observed by 
choudhary et al. 

 

The management of Human Influenza virus is requires 
isolation of infected person with antiviral therapy and 
curative management of other complications. Antiviral 
therapy 
mainly 
includes 
Oseltamivir, 
Zanamivir, 

Peramivir, 
Laninamivir 
which 
are 
neuraminidase 

inhibitors   and Adamantanes such as Amantadine 
and Rimantadine.13,14 Nowadays only NAIs is effective 
against swine flu due development of resistance against 
adamantanes.13,14 In India, Oseltamivir and Zanamivir is 
used for the treatment as well as for the prophylaxis of 
human influenza. According to WHO, Uncomplicated 
cases does not require antiviral therapy, only patients with 
suspected symptoms in high risk group were advocated for 
antiviral therapy. All patients including pregnant females 
were included by WHO for antiviral therapy.

In adults, oseltamivir is prescribed 75 mg twice daily 
regimen for 5 days, while Zanamivir is given in a dose of 
10 mg twice daily, both drugs can be used as prophylaxis 
of swine flu in an once daily regimen. Chemoprophylaxis 
should be given to the healthcare professionals, 
Oseltamivir is given once daily for 10 days and may be 
extended upto 6 weeks depending upon duration of close 
contact to the patients. WHO also recommended the 
vaccine for the healthcare professionals, the response of 
the vaccine will come after 2-3 weeks after vaccination. 
There were some limitation in our study; the power of 
study was low due to less sample size; the mortality was 
not calculated and we unable to find the commonest sign 
and symptoms of human influenza virus in Chhattisgarh 
region of India. 

 

CONCLUSION 

 

The case of Human influenza virus in Chhattisgarh from 
the period of December 2015 to November 2017 was only 
341 which was less than many states of Chhattisgarh. 
Higher incidences were observed in the state capital then 
neighbouring district like Durg and Raigarh. There was no 
significant difference in between gender affected by 
human influenza, while Influenza A was more common 
than H1N1 and H1 subtype among the all received 
samples. The treatment remains the same for swine flu, 
which includes neuraminidase inhibitors   and 
Adamantanes.
